<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Apocalypse should be regarded as a peculiarly interesting
portion of scripture: a blessing being promised those
who read, hear, and keep the things which are written
therein. It has been subjected to so many contradictory
interpretations, that any attempt to comprehend its meaning
is often regarded with distrust; and the impression has
become very prevalent, that it is a <span class="tei tei-q">“sealed book,”</span>—that
its meaning is so hidden in unintelligible symbols, that very
little can be known respecting it; and that to attempt to
unfold its meaning, is to tread presumptuously on forbidden
ground.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The attention of the Christian community has been called
more of late to its study, by the publication of several elaborate
Expositions. One in two large volumes, 8vo., by
Prof. Stuart, was published at Andover, Mass., in 1845. A
large 8vo. volume, by David N. Lord, was issued from the
press of the Harpers, in New York, in 1847; and a smaller
work, by Rev. Thomas Wickes, appeared in that city in
1851. These are the more important works on the subject
which have been published in this country. In England,
the <span class="tei tei-q">“Horæ Apocalypticæ,”</span> by the Rev. E. B. Elliott, A.M.,
late Vicar of Tuxford, and fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge,
has passed through several editions,—the fourth
of which, in four large vols. 8vo., was published in London,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page006">[pg 006]</span><a name="Pg006" id="Pg006" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in 1851. These works, with the writings of Habershon,
Cunningham, Croly, Bickersteth, Birks, Brooks, Keith, and
other distinguished English writers, have caused the study
of the Apocalypse to be regarded with more favor of late
than heretofore.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Expositions of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Mr. Lord</span></span> have thrown much light
on the nature and laws of symbols, by unfolding the principles
in accordance with which they are used. The evolving
of these has removed from many passages the obscurity
which had before caused them to be regarded as enigmatical.
There are, doubtless, many portions of the Apocalypse,
the meaning of which is as yet only dimly perceived,
and which will be more clearly unfolded by the transpiring
of future events; and it would be arrogant to claim that
its interpretation had been freed from all perplexities. But
it is believed that it may be as profitably and as satisfactorily
studied as other portions of Scripture; and that the
reader may feel an assurance of approximating to a knowledge
of the true meaning of its symbolic teachings.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Bible is its own interpreter; and when practicable,
scripture should be explained by scripture. The meaning
imputed to any passage must never contradict, but must
harmonize with that of parallel texts. In illustrating the
several references in the Apocalypse to the same events and
epochs, a repetition of scripture is somewhat unavoidable.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These pages have resulted from notes prepared in a familiar
course of Bible-class instruction, where the study of
brevity was necessary. Without designing to speak dogmatically,
the didactic was found the more direct and simple
mode of expression. In presenting this exposition, merely
as the opinion of the writer, it is with the hope that it will
give, in a small compass, a common-sense view of the intricacies
of this book, and be acceptable to those interested in
the study of prophecy.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">The Grammar</span></span> of any science is a development of the
principles by which it is governed. As the science of interpretation
must be founded on some fixed and uniform laws,
the unfolding of these is the first step in the study of
prophecy.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Biblical Exegesis</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Sacred
Hermeneutics</span></span>, are terms applied to the science of interpretation, or of learning
the meaning of Biblical words and phrases.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">The Usus Loquendi</span></span>, is the usual mode of speaking.
When applied to the Scriptures, it denotes the general
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">scriptural use</span></span> of words.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. To learn the meaning of scriptural terms, their general
use must be ascertained, by comparing their contexts in the
several places of their occurrence.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
5. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Prophecy</span></span> is the prediction of a future event. The
term sometimes denotes a book of prophecies (Rev. 22:18);
and sometimes a history.—2 Chron. 9:29.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
6. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Consecutive</span></span> Prophecy gives the succession of future
events in the order in which they will transpire.
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Examples.</span></span>—See
Dan. 2d, 7th, 8th, 11th, and Rev. 6th and 7th,
9th to the 11th; 12th and 15th, &amp;c.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
7. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Discursive</span></span> Prophecy presents future events, irrespective
of the order of their occurrence.
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Examples.</span></span>—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Isaiah</span></span>
and the minor prophets.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
8. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Conditional</span></span> Prophecy is when the fulfilment is dependent
on the compliance of those to whom the promise is
made, with the conditions on which it is given.
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Examples.</span></span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">If</span></em>
ye walk in my statutes and keep my commandments,
and do them: then I will give you rain in due season,
and the land shall yield her increase, and the trees of
the field shall yield their fruit.”</span> Lev. 26:3, 4. <span class="tei tei-q">“But <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">if</span></em>
ye will <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em> hearken unto me, and will <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em> do all
these commandments; and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">if</span></em> ye shall despise my statutes, or if your
soul abhor my judgments, so that ye will not do all my
commandments, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">but</span></em> that ye break my covenant: I also will
do this unto you, I will even appoint over you terror, consumption,
and the burning ague, that shall consume the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page008">[pg 008]</span><a name="Pg008" id="Pg008" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
eyes, and cause sorrow of heart: and ye shall sow your
seed in vain; for your enemies shall eat it.”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ib.</span></span> 14-16.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“And it shall come to pass, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">if</span></em> thou shalt hearken diligently
unto the voice of the Lord thy God, to observe and
to do all his commandments which I command thee this
day: that the Lord thy God will set thee on high above all
nations of the earth: and all these blessings shall come on
thee, and overtake thee, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">if</span></em> thou shalt hearken unto the voice
of the Lord thy God.”</span> Deut. 28:1, 2. <span class="tei tei-q">“But it shall
come to pass, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">if</span></em> thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of the
Lord thy God, to observe to do all his commandments and
his statutes which I command thee this day: that all these
curses shall come upon thee, and overtake thee,”</span> &amp;c. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ib.</span></span>
15.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Predictions of mere national prosperity, or adversity, are
usually conditional. When the condition is not expressed,
it is implied. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Example.</span></span>—The Lord said unto Jonah,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Arise, go unto Nineveh, that great city, and preach unto
it the preaching that I bid thee.... And Jonah began to
enter into the city a day's journey, and he cried, and said,
Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown. So the
people of Nineveh believed God, and proclaimed a fast, and
put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least
of them.... And God saw their works, that they turned
from their evil way; and God repented of the evil that
he had said that he would do unto them: and he did it
not.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
For all cases of this kind, the Lord has given the following
general <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Rule</span></span>: <span class="tei tei-q">“At what instant I shall speak concerning
a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up,
and to pull down, and to destroy it: if that nation against
whom I have pronounced turn from their evil, I will repent
of the evil that I thought to do unto them. And at what
instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a
kingdom, to build and to plant it; if it do evil in my
sight, that it obey not my voice, then I will repent of the
good wherewith I said I would benefit them.”</span> Jer. 18:7-10.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
9. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Unconditional</span></span> Prophecy includes all predictions
which are absolute in their nature. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Examples.</span></span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“But
as truly as I live, all the earth shall be filled with the glory

Past <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">historical</span></em> events, instead of supposititious ones, are

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As God had provided for a more full <span class="tei tei-q">“revelation”</span>
respecting the events of the future, it
was necessary that it should be communicated
through <span class="tei tei-q">“the appointed Heir of all things,”</span> by
whom he was to speak in the last days, Heb.
1:2. The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Baptist</span></span> said of Christ, that <span class="tei tei-q">“what

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The design of God in giving this additional
revelation, was that he might <span class="tei tei-q">“show unto
his servants things which must shortly come
to pass;”</span> for <span class="tei tei-q">“surely the Lord God doeth
nothing, but he revealeth his secrets unto his

saith, <span class="tei tei-q">“I have told you before it come to pass,
that when it is come to pass ye might believe,”</span>
John 14:29. When the old world was
to be destroyed by water, <span class="tei tei-q">“Noah, being
warned of God of things not seen as yet, prepared
an ark to the saving of his house,”</span> Heb.
11:7. And when the Lord had purposed the
destruction of Sodom, he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Shall I hide
from Abraham that thing which I do?”</span> and
angels were sent to Lot, that he might say to
his children, <span class="tei tei-q">“Up get ye out of this place; for
the Lord will destroy this city,”</span> Gen. 18:17,
and 19:14. So of the times and seasons of
the second advent: while <span class="tei tei-q">“the day of the Lord
so cometh as a thief in the night,”</span> he has said
to his chosen ones, <span class="tei tei-q">“Ye brethren are not in
darkness that that day should overtake you
as a thief,”</span> 1 Thess. 5:1-4. He has condescended
to give his people <span class="tei tei-q">“a more sure word
of prophecy: whereunto ye do well that ye
take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a
dark place, until the day dawn, and the day
star arise in your hearts,”</span> 2 Pet. 1:19.
Therefore it was said to John, <span class="tei tei-q">“I will show
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page021">[pg 021]</span><a name="Pg021" id="Pg021" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
thee things which must be hereafter,”</span> Rev. 4:1;
which things were shortly to begin to come
to pass,—they being a series of successive
events, commencing near the time in which
John wrote, and extending to the end of the
world and the establishment of the everlasting
kingdom.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These were shown to John by symbolic representations,
in a series of visions, the import
of which was signified to him by an angelic
interpreter. Said the Saviour, <span class="tei tei-q">“I, Jesus, have
sent my angel to testify unto you these things
in the churches,”</span> 22:16. And <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">these things</span></em>
were not to be sealed up, like the words of
Daniel; for John was commanded to <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">seal
not</span></em> the sayings of the prophecy of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">this</span></em> book:
for the time is at hand,”</span> 22:10. He recorded
the words which God thus gave him,—<span class="tei tei-q">“the
testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all things
that he saw.”</span> He has given us, in graphic
language, such descriptions of the visions
shown, that we can easily imagine the symbols
which he saw; and we have the inspired
explanations of those which were <span class="tei tei-q">“signified”</span>
to him. Therefore we may read, and receive
the blessings promised to those who keep this
testimony of Jesus.

said: <span class="tei tei-q">“See that ye refuse not him that speaketh;
for if they escaped not who refused him

escape, if we turn away from him that speaketh

thus neglect it, cannot regard the blessing
promised to those who read, hear, and keep
its sayings.

The seven churches to which John sends
salutation, were those of Ephesus, Smyrna,
Pergamos, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and
Laodicea, 1:11. The Asia, in which they
were situated, was a province in Asia Minor,
distinct from Pontus, Gallatia, and Bithynia;
which also were in Asia Minor, 1 Pet. 1:1,
and Acts 2:9. Of the province of Asia,
Ephesus was the capital, and was the principal
place of John's residence. The seven
cities which contained those churches, were
situated in a kind of amphitheatre, surrounded
by mountains. Smyrna was 46 miles north of
Ephesus, and Pergamos 64 miles; Thyatira
was 48 miles to the east, and Sardis 33 miles;
Philadelphia 27 miles to the south, and Laodicea
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page024">[pg 024]</span><a name="Pg024" id="Pg024" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
42 miles. These churches had all been
under the general supervision of John's ministry;
and for this reason, doubtless, they are
especially designated, instead of those with
which he had not been so intimately connected.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
John writes to the seven churches, in obedience
to the command,—<span class="tei tei-q">“What thou seest,
write in a book, and send it unto the seven
churches which are in Asia,”</span> 1:11. He
seems to have written what he saw, at the
time of its exhibition, and not at the close of
the entire presentation; for when he was
about to write the discordant utterances of
<span class="tei tei-q">“the seven thunders,”</span> he was told to <span class="tei tei-q">“write
them not,”</span> 10:4.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
John observes the oriental custom of placing
his name at the commencement, instead
of the close of his communication. Few persons
now deny that this was John the Evangelist.
Irenæus, who was born only about
30 years after the death of John, speaks of
the writer of the Apocalypse, as <span class="tei tei-q">“the disciple
of Christ,—that same John that leaned on
his breast at the last supper.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Most beautiful reference is here made to the
attributes of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Deity</span></span>: <span class="tei tei-q">“Him who is, and who
was, and who is to be,”</span> can be no other
than the great Preëxistent, who said to Moses,
<span class="tei tei-q">“I AM THAT I AM,”</span> Ex. 13:14.

The seven Spirits, would seem to be irrelevantly
placed between the Father and the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page025">[pg 025]</span><a name="Pg025" id="Pg025" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Son,—the place always occupied by the
Holy Spirit, when spoken of in connection
with them,—if they were merely seven
angels. Grace would also seem to be irreverently
invoked from such,—its presence
being implied where it is invoked,—unless
they are expressive of the Holy Spirit, in
which grace is inherent, and from whom it
may be communicated; as it may not be from
angels. Seven is a full and perfect number,
and it may be here used because in another
place <span class="tei tei-q">“seven lamps of fire burning before the
throne”</span> are symbolic of <span class="tei tei-q">“the seven Spirits of
God,”</span> (4:5); which, if angels, would be expressly
named, as in other inspired explanations,—as
they are in that of the stars, 1:20.
A burning <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">flame</span></em> is often used as a symbol of
the Holy Spirit. Thus, when God would
make a covenant with Abraham, and the victims
between which the covenanting parties
were to pass, were divided, the presence of
God was symbolized by <span class="tei tei-q">“a burning lamp
that passed between those pieces,”</span> Gen. 15:17.
And the descent of the Holy Spirit on the
day of Pentecost, was manifested by <span class="tei tei-q">“cloven
tongues, like as of fire,”</span> which <span class="tei tei-q">“sat upon
each of them,”</span> Acts 2:3. In Zechariah 3:9,
we read of the symbol of a stone laid before
Joshua, that on it were engraved <span class="tei tei-q">“seven
eyes,”</span> which <span class="tei tei-q">“are the eyes of the Lord which
run to and fro, through the whole earth,”</span>
(Zech. 4:10);—an expressive figure of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page026">[pg 026]</span><a name="Pg026" id="Pg026" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
God's Omniscience. The same is symbolized in
Rev. 5:6, by the <span class="tei tei-q">“seven eyes”</span> of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lamb</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Jesus Christ is the faithful Witness. He
<span class="tei tei-q">“was faithful to him that appointed him,”</span>
(Heb. 3:2); and he was given as a Witness
to the people, a Leader and Commander to
the people, Isa. 55:4. He is the <span class="tei tei-q">“first-begotten
of the dead,”</span> having <span class="tei tei-q">“risen from the
dead, and become the first fruits of them that
slept,”</span> 1 Cor. 15:20: he is <span class="tei tei-q">“declared to be
the Son of God, with power according to the
spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the
dead,”</span> Rom. 1:4. He is <span class="tei tei-q">“the Prince of the
kings of the earth,”</span> the <span class="tei tei-q">“King of kings and
Lord of lords,”</span> 19:16; <span class="tei tei-q">“all kings shall fall
down before him: all nations shall serve
him,”</span> Psa. 72:11. He hath shown how he
<span class="tei tei-q">“loved us,”</span> by giving himself for us, (Gal.
2:20); and hath cleansed his people from all
sin, not <span class="tei tei-q">“by the blood of goats and calves,
but by his own blood, he entered in once into
the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption
for us,”</span> Heb. 9:12. He has redeemed
us to God <span class="tei tei-q">“out of every kindred, and
tongue, and people, and nation,”</span> Rev. 5:9.
He is the one who is to come in the clouds of
heaven, in resplendent majesty, to reward his
saints, and to destroy those who destroy the
earth, 11:18. The announcement that he
<span class="tei tei-q">“cometh with clouds”</span> is as if John had said
that what he was commanded to write, was a
revelation of the events which were to precede
and usher in that coming.

The <span class="tei tei-q">“seven golden candlesticks,”</span> symbolize
<span class="tei tei-q">“the seven churches”</span> (1:20), to which
John was commanded to write. By this, and
other symbols which are divinely interpreted,
are unfolded the principles on which symbols
are used. A candle or lamp stand, supports
the light placed on it, as churches are the recipients
and dispensers of the light of the Holy
Scriptures. They are therefore appropriate
symbols of churches.

the likeness of the glory of the Lord,”</span> (Ezek.
1:26-28); and before which Daniel fell
trembling, Dan. 10:5-9. The sublime
spectacle was too overwhelming for John's
endurance, and, like Isaiah, Ezekiel, and
Daniel, his strength turned to corruption.
But the glorified Saviour was the same sympathetic
being on whose breast John leaned,
at the last supper, and he lays his endearing
hand on John, and, by soothing words, restores
his confidence. He explains the mystery

contained in the symbols shown, and
enjoins on him to write the things he had seen—symbolic
of the things which then were,

As no created resemblance is a fit representative

The angel of the church in Smyrna is supposed
to have been Polycarp, who, rather than
to apostatize, was burnt alive in that city
about A. D. 166. That church had passed
through the trial of poverty, and was found
<span class="tei tei-q">“rich toward God,”</span> Luke 12:21. It had suffered
from the blasphemy of unbelieving Jews,
who had a synagogue there and were particularly
active at the martyrdom of Polycarp.
But <span class="tei tei-q">“He is not a Jew, which is one outwardly;

of Balaam, who taught Balak to cast an enticement

Repent; or else I will come to thee quickly, and will fight

one who was followed by the armies of heaven,
when <span class="tei tei-q">“the remnant were slain with the sword

The church of Pergamos had refrained from
apostasy, although situated in a wicked and
corrupt city,—even where Satan reigned almost
supreme and received the obedience of
its inhabitants. They had been faithful in
those days when Antipas, a faithful Christian,
and probably the former pastor of the church,
was slain (Dr. Hales thinks) in Domitian's
persecution, in A. D. 94. Yet, the Lord had
some things against them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The doctrine of Balaam is what that prophet
counselled Balak to cast as a stumbling-block
before Israel: For <span class="tei tei-q">“the people began to commit
whoredom with the daughters of Moab.
And they called the people unto the sacrifices
of their gods; and the people did eat and
bowed down to their gods. And Israel joined
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page039">[pg 039]</span><a name="Pg039" id="Pg039" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
himself unto Baal-peor,”</span> Num. 25:1-3.
And Moses said of the women of Midian,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Behold, these caused the children of Israel,
through the counsel of Balaam, to commit trespass
against the Lord in the matter of Peor,”</span>
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ib.</span></span> 31:16. This was also, probably, the same
as the doctrine of the Nicolaitanes, p. <a href="#Pg034" class="tei tei-ref">34</a>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <span class="tei tei-q">“hidden manna”</span> seems to be a reference
to that hidden in the ark, where it was laid
up before the Lord (Ex. 16:33), in memory
of what was sent for the sustenance of Israel
in the wilderness, where <span class="tei tei-q">“man did eat angel's
food,”</span> Ps. 78:25. The law having a shadow
of good things to come (Heb. 10:1), the manna
hidden in the ark may be typical of the angelic
sustenance to be revealed in the future
world. The Saviour said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Verily, verily, I
say unto you, He that believeth on me hath
everlasting life. I am that bread of life.
This is the bread which cometh down from

The <span class="tei tei-q">“white stone”</span> has received divers interpretations.
In ancient trials, the votes of
the judges were given by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">white</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">black</span></em> pebbles.
The former signified acquittal, and the
latter condemnation. Conquerors in public
games sometimes received a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">white stone</span></em> with
their name inscribed on it, which entitled
them, during the remainder of their life, to be
maintained at the public expense. Persons
were sometimes invited to feasts or banquets,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page040">[pg 040]</span><a name="Pg040" id="Pg040" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
by the presentation of a white stone, with their
name on it in connection with that of their
hosts. The possession of the white stone evidently
entitles the possessor to all the privileges
of the heavenly inheritance.

The <span class="tei tei-q">“new name”</span> is unknown to all but

The church of Philadelphia had maintained
her integrity, and is therefore addressed in the
language of commendation, without the rebukes
which were directed to her sister
churches. Having remained true to Him
who <span class="tei tei-q">“was called Faithful and True”</span> (19:11),
the epistle to this church makes mention
of the Saviour by those titles, which are significant
of his own faithfulness and inherent
holiness.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The key of David,”</span> brings to view the
prediction of that which was to be laid <span class="tei tei-q">“upon
his shoulder;”</span> so that <span class="tei tei-q">“he shall open, and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page047">[pg 047]</span><a name="Pg047" id="Pg047" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
none shall shut; and he shall shut, and none
shall open,”</span> Isa. 22:22. A key symbolizes that
which will open or unlock, or will close fast:
therefore said the Saviour, <span class="tei tei-q">“I ... have the
keys of hell and of death.”</span> By virtue of this
power, an open door was set before the church
of Philadelphia, which no man should be able
to close.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Jews in Philadelphia, who had claimed
to be the only true church of God, but who
were in reality of the synagogue of Satan,
were to cease their opposition to the Christians,
and to seek instruction and protection
from them—recognizing the love of God to
Gentiles as well as to Jews. History is silent
respecting the fulfilment of this; but there is
no reason to suppose that it was not literally
fulfilled.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <span class="tei tei-q">“hour of temptation,”</span> which was to
<span class="tei tei-q">“come upon all the world, to try them that
dwell on the earth,”</span> was to be one of peculiar
trial. Some suppose it had reference to the
persecution under Trajan, which was more
severe and extensive than those under Nero,
or Domitian: and others that it was the Mohammedan
delusion. In such times there are
peculiar temptations to apostatize, and the less
faithful are in more danger of apostasy than
others. But because the Philadelphian church
had been faithful thus far, they were to be kept
from that trying hour. When the scourge
of Mohammedanism swept over all the other
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page048">[pg 048]</span><a name="Pg048" id="Pg048" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
churches of Asia, this church maintained its
integrity. Says Gibbon: <span class="tei tei-q">“Among the Greek
colonies and churches of Asia, Philadelphia is
still erect, a column in a scene of ruins. At a
distance from the sea, forgotten by the emperors,
encompassed on all sides by the Turks,
her valiant citizens defended their religion and
their freedom above fourscore years, and at
length capitulated with the proudest of the
Ottomans.”</span> Philadelphia is still the seat of
an archbishop, and contains from six hundred
to seven hundred Greek houses, and several
places of Christian worship. <span class="tei tei-q">“The Lord
knoweth how to deliver the godly out of
temptations,”</span> 2 Pet. 2:9.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
They are encouraged to constancy by the
prospect of the coming coronation day, when
<span class="tei tei-q">“the Lord; the righteous Judge shall give”</span> a
<span class="tei tei-q">“crown of righteousness,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“unto all them
that love his appearing,”</span> 2 Tim. 4:8. He
has said <span class="tei tei-q">“Be thou faithful unto death, and I
will give thee a crown of life”</span> (2:10); and
therefore <span class="tei tei-q">“when the chief Shepherd shall appear,
ye shall receive a crown of glory that
fadeth not away,”</span> 1 Pet. 5:4.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A pillar in the temple of God, is expressive
of a position which shall give support to the
church, which is erected <span class="tei tei-q">“upon the foundation

the building, fitly framed together, groweth

To receive the name of God, is to be recognized
as belonging to God. As masters designated
their servants by branding their name
on them, or by some peculiar mark, so the
children of God are referred to by the same
figure. In a subsequent vision John saw with
the Lamb on Mount Zion, <span class="tei tei-q">“an hundred and
forty and four thousand, having his Father's
name written in their foreheads,”</span> 14:1. Their
connection with new Jerusalem is similarly
designated.

By his titles of truth and verity, the Saviour
prepares the Laodiceans for the humiliating
threatenings, which are uttered against them.
By that of <span class="tei tei-q">“the beginning of the creation of
God,”</span> is indicated Christ's kingship as head
and governor of all; and hence the authority
on which his declarations are founded.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Laodiceans seemed to have been very
well satisfied with their own condition, without
possessing any very marked characteristics.
They were neither good, nor very
wicked; but supposed that they abounded in
all spiritual wealth, when they were destitute
of all the Christian graces. They could not
appreciate their own condition; and not realizing
their need, were unlikely to heed the
counsel given them, and therefore they have
long since ceased to have a name and a place
on the earth. Says Gibbon: <span class="tei tei-q">“The circus
and three stately temples of Laodicea, are
now peopled with wolves and foxes.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The great majority of them seemed to have
become unworthy even of the chastisement
which God bestows on those he loves. <span class="tei tei-q">“Behold,
happy is the man whom God correcteth;
therefore despise not the chastening of the Almighty,”</span>
Job 5:17. <span class="tei tei-q">“My son, despise not

of his correction: For whom the Lord loveth
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page051">[pg 051]</span><a name="Pg051" id="Pg051" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
he correcteth, even as a father the son in
whom he delighteth,”</span> Prov. 3:11, 12.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Blessed is the man that endureth temptation:
for when he is tried, he shall receive
the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised
to them that love him,”</span> Jas. 1:12.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Saviour shows his readiness to receive
those who will open unto him. He is saying,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Open to me ... for my head is filled with
dew, and my locks with the drops of the
night,”</span> Cant. 5:2. <span class="tei tei-q">“Blessed are those servants,
whom the Lord, when he cometh, shall
find watching: verily I say unto you, That
he shall gird himself, and make them to sit
down to meat, and will come forth and serve
them,”</span> Luke 12:37. Said Jesus, <span class="tei tei-q">“If any
man love me, he will keep my words: and
my Father will love him, and we will come
unto him, and make our abode with him,”</span>
John 14:23.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To him that overcometh, as in another

a rainbow around the throne, in appearance, like an emerald.
And around the throne were twenty-four thrones;

from the throne came forth lightnings, and voices and thunders.
And seven lamps of fire were burning before the

who liveth for ever and ever, the four and twenty elders fall
down before Him seated on the throne, and worship Him,

This vision is preparatory to the revelations

Their divine origin, and, consequently,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page053">[pg 053]</span><a name="Pg053" id="Pg053" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the deference with which they are to

by this symbolization of the presence
chamber of the Almighty.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The revelator had before heard a voice
speaking to him, (1:10); and turning to look,
he beheld the risen Saviour. He then writes
the epistles which the Saviour dictated to the
churches; and again he turns his eyes to the
place where the voice spake to him.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The opening of a door in heaven, appears
to be no part of the <span class="tei tei-q">“things which must be
hereafter;”</span> and is, therefore, no symbol. It
was doubtless an appearance of an aperture
in the sky above, through which the revelator
saw the vision. It indicates that he looked
through and beyond the limits prescribed to
human vision; and the summons to <span class="tei tei-q">“come
up hither,”</span> indicates that he was to have free
access to the secrets there to be unfolded.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A <span class="tei tei-q">“throne set in heaven,”</span> is a symbol of

glory and majesty, being indicated by the
<span class="tei tei-q">“lightnings, thunderings and voices,”</span> the
<span class="tei tei-q">“rainbow round about the throne,”</span> and the
resemblance to brilliant gems. It is the same
Being, seen in vision by Ezekiel (1:28), round

The <span class="tei tei-q">“elders”</span> seated about the throne, and

voice, Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose its seals?
and no one in heaven, or on the earth, or under the earth,
was able to open the book nor to look in it. And I was
weeping much, because no one was found worthy to open,
and to read the book, nor to look in it. And one of the
elders saith to me, Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe
of Judah, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the
book, and to loose its seven seals. And I saw in the midst
of the throne, and of the four living beings, and in the
midst of the elders, the Lamb standing, as having been slain,
having seven horns, and seven eyes, which are the seven
Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth. And he came
and took the book out of the right hand of Him seated on the
throne. And when he took the book, the living beings, and
twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, all of them
having harps, and golden bowls full of incense, which are
the prayers of saints. And they sung a new song, saying,
Worthy art thou to take the book and to open its seals: for
thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood
out of every tribe, and tongue, and people, and nation; and
hast made us kings and priests to our God, and we shall

with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb, that was slain, to
receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and
honor, and glory, and blessing. And every creature which
is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and
those on the sea, even all that are in them, I heard saying,
Blessing, and honor, and glory, and power, be to Him sitting

which were about to be unfolded on
the loosening of the seals. Its being written
within and without, indicates the fulness of
its contents, the completeness of the record:—God's
purposes being fully and unalterably
formed. In like manner Ezekiel was shown
<span class="tei tei-q">“a roll of a book ... written within and without,”</span>
symbolizing the <span class="tei tei-q">“lamentations, mourning

to overtake Israel.

A sealed book is one whose contents are
hidden: <span class="tei tei-q">“The vision of all is become unto
you as the words of a book that is sealed,
which men deliver to one that is learned,
saying, Read this I pray thee: and he saith,
I cannot; for it is sealed,”</span> Isa. 29:11. God
said to Daniel, <span class="tei tei-q">“Shut up the words, and seal
the book, till the time of the end,”</span> Dan. 12:4.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To open the seals, no one was found worthy.
There was no being in heaven among the
angels, no human being on the earth, and no
disembodied spirit, or demon, under the earth,
who was able to unfold the future. The
tears of the revelator are, however, dried, and
his drooping spirits cheered, by the announcement
of one of the elders, that <span class="tei tei-q">“the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lion</span></span> of
the tribe of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Judah</span></span>, the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Root</span></span>
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">David</span></span>, hath
prevailed to open the book,”</span> and to unfold its
mysteries. He stood in the midst of the
assembled intelligences,—his human nature
and sacrificial office, being designated by his
metaphorical title of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Lamb:”</span>—John
seeing Jesus coming to him said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Behold the

shown by the <span class="tei tei-q">“seven horns,”</span> the symbols of
power; and his relation to the Godhead, by
the seven eyes, the seven Spirits of God;—expressive
of the Holy Spirit. See p. <a href="#Pg025" class="tei tei-ref">25</a>.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The rejoicings on the announcement of
Christ's ability to take the book, and to open
the seals, indicate the greatness of the blessing
which God gives the church, when he
thus reveals a knowledge of the future.
All creatures should join in these hosannas,
and praise the Lord for his great condescension,
in showing his servants the things
which must shortly come to pass. To neglect
this revelation, is not joining in the ascription
of praise.

The golden vials, full of odors, symbolize
the prayers of saints. Under the Mosaic dispensation,
the frankincense and odors offered at
the tabernacle were emblematic of prayer and
praise to God. <span class="tei tei-q">“Let my prayer be set forth
before thee as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">incense</span></em>; and the lifting up of

Christ takes the book from the hand of him
who sits on the throne, and opens the seals.
Thus he makes known unto his servants the
revelation which God had given him, 1:1.
As each successive seal is opened, successive

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The voice is evidently addressed to the personage
on the white horse, or to the agencies
thus symbolized. It is the signal for their
appearance on the stage of action.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The symbol is that of a victorious warrior,
armed with weapons of conquest,—success
being indicated by the crown given him. As
there is no analogous order, except in the religious
world, Mr. Lord very properly regards
it as a symbol of the body of religious teachers,
those faithful soldiers of the cross, who,
from the middle of the first to the middle of
the third century, as <span class="tei tei-q">“soldiers of Jesus
Christ”</span> (2 Tim. 2:3), went forth to war
<span class="tei tei-q">“against principalities and powers, against
the rulers of the darkness of this world,
against spiritual wickedness in high places,”</span>
Eph. 6:12. The apostle, when they received
their commission, said to them, <span class="tei tei-q">“Take
unto you the whole armor of God, that ye
may be able to withstand in the evil day, and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page059">[pg 059]</span><a name="Pg059" id="Pg059" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
having done all, to stand. Stand, therefore,
having your loins girt about with truth, and
having on the breast-plate of righteousness;
and your feet shod with the preparation of the
gospel of peace; above all, taking the shield
of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench
all the fiery darts of the wicked. And take
the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the
Spirit, which is the word of God,”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ib.</span></span> 13-17.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus equipped, they went forth, conquering
and to conquer. They assailed the strong-holds
of sin and Satan, and planted the standard of
the cross in all portions of the then civilized
world. And at the end of their warfare thousands
of them could say with the apostle: <span class="tei tei-q">“I
have fought a good fight, I have finished my
course, I have kept the faith: henceforth there
is laid up for me a crown of righteousness,
which the Lord, the righteous Judge, shall
give me at that day: and not to me only, but
unto all them also that love his appearing,”</span>
2 Tim. 4:7, 8.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The period symbolized under this seal, was
distinguished for purity of faith in the church,
and devotion to the cause of Christ,—indicated
by the whiteness of the horse that the
warrior rides.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This symbol, like the former, is that of a
mounted warrior, and must also symbolize a
body of religious teachers. The color of the
horse, indicates that the doctrine and character
of the body symbolized will have lost the
original purity of the church, and become
more sanguinary; which is also indicated by
the great sword given him.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The warfare under this seal is not against
outside enemies; for they kill each other.
This, then, indicates an era when the church
shall be disquieted, and her peace interrupted
by internal dissensions. Such was its history
during the third, fourth, and fifth centuries.
This period was distinguished for the contentions
of the clergy; their usurpation of
power not conferred by the apostles; their
divisions and sub-divisions into parties; their
opposing councils; their collisions and distractions;
their love of power; their pride,
discord, strife, and tyranny; their mutual
anathemas and excommunications; the envy,
jealousy, and detraction they indulged in, and
the other hateful passions which they exercised.
Thus they marred the peace of the
church; and by causing many to apostatize,
killed each other with spiritual death.

This foreshadows a period of great scarcity
and cruel exactions. Applying it to the only
department of society which is analogous to
civil life, and the famine symbolized, is like
that predicted by Amos: <span class="tei tei-q">“Behold, the days
come, saith the Lord God, that I will send a
famine into the land, not a famine of bread,
nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the
words of the Lord: and they shall wander
from sea to sea, and from the north even to
the east; they shall run to and fro to seek the
word of the Lord, and shall not find it,”</span>
Amos 8:11, 12.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This, then, marks a period when the traditions
and opinions of men are substituted for
the word of God. With Origen was introduced
a new mode of interpreting scripture,
which afterwards became prevalent. The
scriptures, instead of being received in their
natural and obvious sense, were regarded as
mystical and allegorical. Milner, in his
Church History, says: <span class="tei tei-q">“From the fanciful
mode of allegory, introduced by him, and uncontrolled
by scriptural rule and order, there
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page062">[pg 062]</span><a name="Pg062" id="Pg062" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
arose a vitiated method of commenting on the
sacred pages.”</span> And Mosheim says: <span class="tei tei-q">“The
few who explained the sacred writings with
judgment and a true spirit of criticism, could
not oppose, with any success, the torrent of
allegory that was overflowing the church.”</span>
Following this example, Luther says, <span class="tei tei-q">“men
make just what they please of the Scriptures,
until some accommodate the word of God
to the most extravagant absurdities.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Substituting the conceptions of their own
fancy for the word of God, they withheld
from the people the bread of life, and produced
a famine for the word of the Lord. Crude
notions took the place of Bible doctrines; and
pernicious speculations were substituted for
the teachings of Christ and his apostles. Baptism
and the Lord's supper, lost their emblematic
significance, and were regarded as
saving ordinances. Heaven was sought to be
merited by works, and sanctification was supposed
to be gained by penance and mortification
of the flesh. In short, all the corruptions
of the apostasy were substituted for the primitive
faith, and the Bible became a sealed book
to the great mass of the people.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Christian church alone being analogous
to the civil power, it is within its pale
that the fulfilment of this symbol is to be
looked for. During this period, violence is
substituted for famine; and men are compelled
to apostatize, which results in spiritual death.
The Papacy having the power to enforce her
decrees, Christians had to embrace her faith,
or be handed over to the secular power for
punishment. They produced death by compelling
men to apostatize, by withholding
from them the word of life, by infusing into
their minds pestiferous doctrines, and by the
fear of the civil power,—symbolized by the
sword, famine, pestilence, and beasts of the
earth.

whose souls are seen in vision, and another
time of persecution to follow. Consequently,
the symbol represents the disembodied spirits
of those who had already been slain. They
symbolize the souls of martyrs who counted
not their lives dear unto themselves for the
sake of Christ; and being faithful unto death,
were in expectation of a crown of life. Says
Mr. Lord: <span class="tei tei-q">“The term τα πτωματα is used in
the prophecy to denote the dead bodies of the
martyrs (chap. 11:9), and αι ψυψαι (20:4)
to denote their disembodied spirits. They are
represented as having been slain, and as uttering
their appeal to God because of their blood
having been shed.”</span> Also: <span class="tei tei-q">“The martyr
souls are exhibited in their own persons;
and obviously because no others could serve
as their symbol,—there being no others that
have undergone a change from a bodied to a
disembodied life, nor that sustain such relations
to God, of forgiveness, acceptance, and
assurance of a resurrection from death, and a
priesthood with Christ during his victorious
reign on the earth,”</span> Ex. Apoc. p. 155.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The altar, symbolizes the atonement made
by Christ for sin; and, consequently, the position
of the souls of the martyrs under it,
indicates their reliance on him for an inheritance
in his everlasting kingdom,—when <span class="tei tei-q">“he
shall come to be glorified in his saints,”</span> and
to <span class="tei tei-q">“take vengeance on them that know not
God, and obey not the gospel,”</span> 2 Thess. 1:8,

The presentation of white robes to them,
symbolizes their acceptance and justification.

The declaration that they must rest till <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">their
fellow-servants are killed</span></em>, as they have been,
implies another persecution, to be subsequent
to the period symbolized by the opening of
this seal. The persecutions which followed
the Reformation, in which the fires of Smithfield
were lighted in England, the Huguenots
were driven from France, and thousands suffered
martyrdom, probably fulfilled this.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The interest taken by the souls of the martyrs
in the avenging of their blood on the
earth, shows that the spirits of departed saints
look forward with intense interest to the time
of their glorification. And although the dead
who die in the Lord are blessed, the glories of
the resurrection morn are not less desired by
those who are absent from the body and present
with the Lord, than by humble, devoted,
waiting Christians here.

The laws of symbolization require that
symbols should not be representatives of their
own order when there is any analogous order
to be representatives of. In other places in
the Apocalypse, these symbols are used, under
circumstances where it is impossible to
regard them as symbols of their own order.
And here, as the kings of the earth call on
the rocks and mountains to fall on them
after the heaven has departed as a scroll and
every mountain and island is moved out of
its place, it is necessary to regard them as
symbols of objects of analogous orders.

and the fall of the stars, their ejection from

The symbols here presented, were seen immediately
subsequent to the exhibition of the
preceding ones. This alone would not prove
that the events symbolized follow in order, but
it is indicated by their being a continuation
of the symbolization under the sixth seal, and
before the opening of the seventh.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the sixth chapter, the great men and rich
men, as well as bond-men, are aware of the
proximity of the day of the Lord, and seek
for a refuge from the face of the Lamb. The
next events in consecutive order, would be the
resurrection of the righteous dead, the change
of the living, their ascension to meet the Lord
in the air, and the infliction of the wrath of
God on the wicked.

After the wicked seek to escape from God's

terror of the wicked, at the appearance of the
Saviour.

The four winds are the winds coming from
all directions; and symbolize strife, war, and
commotion among men, analogous to the violent
action of the winds of heaven.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In Dan. 7:2, the striving of the four winds
upon the great sea preceded the rising of the
four beasts: in other words, the various contests
and strifes among the different people
and tongues of earth resulted in the establishment
of the successive empires which have
arisen to universal dominion. The blowing
of the wind seems to be any influence exerted
upon men. In Ezek. 37:9 the breathing of
the wind revives the dead; and in Zech. 5:9
it symbolizes the removal of the wickedness
of the Jews.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The angels holding the winds, consequently,
must symbolize the agencies which have the
power to excite or quell these disturbing influences.
They do the bidding of the Lord in
restraining or exerting the influences which
should produce the effect symbolized. The
holding of them indicates the proximity and
certainty of their blowing unless they are
restrained. The earth, sea, and trees, which
would be hurt by the blowing of the wind,
evidently symbolize the different classes of
inhabitants of the earth, on whom an effect
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page070">[pg 070]</span><a name="Pg070" id="Pg070" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
would be produced by the blowing of the
winds, analogous to the effect produced on
those elements by a violent tempest, or hurricane.
The storm here symbolized is evidently
that of which the Scriptures speak.
<span class="tei tei-q">“On the wicked he shall rain snares, fire
and brimstone, and an horrible tempest,”</span> Psa.
11:6. <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou shalt be visited of the Lord
of hosts with thunder, and with earthquake,
and great noise, with storm and tempest, and
the flame of devouring fire,”</span> Isa. 29:6. <span class="tei tei-q">“The
Lord hath a mighty and strong one, which
as a tempest of hail, and a destroying storm,
as flood of waters overflowing, shall cast
down to the earth with the hand,”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ib.</span></span> 28:2.

The sealing of the servants of God in their
foreheads, designates them, but does not constitute
them such; for none are sealed, only
those who are previously his. This is in allusion
to the ancient custom of stamping with
a hot iron the name of the owner on the forehead
or shoulder of his slave. Before the
final destruction of Jerusalem by the Babylonians,
Ezekiel saw in vision a man clothed in
linen, with a writer's ink-horn by his side,
who was commissioned to go through the
midst of Jerusalem and set a mark on the
foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry
for all the abominations that be done in the
midst thereof. And the destroying angels
who were commanded to slay all, both old
and young, to spare not, nor to have pity,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page071">[pg 071]</span><a name="Pg071" id="Pg071" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
were expressly told to <span class="tei tei-q">“come not near any
man upon whom is the mark,”</span> Ezek. 9:2-6.
When the destroying angel passed through
Egypt, on the night of the Passover, <span class="tei tei-q">“to slay
all the first-born of that nation, the houses
of the Israelites were indicated by the blood
of the Paschal Lamb sprinkled on their lintels
and door-posts; and by these the angels
passed,”</span> Ex. 12:23. Thus in the present
instance, before the descent of the impending
storm, the servants of the Lord are to be indicated
by the seal of the living God in their
foreheads, and will be spared the horrible tempest
which will <span class="tei tei-q">“hurt”</span> all those on whom it
shall fall.

The 144,000,—the whole number sealed,
is a perfect number,—an appropriate symbol
of all the living righteous on the earth. The
twelve tribes, then, would symbolize all the
branches of Christ's mystical body in which
the servants of God are found. The pious
dead would need no mark indicative of their
acceptance, having previously, in the white
robes given them, received the symbols of
their justification, 6:11. That their resurrection
and the changing of the living, immediately
succeeded, is evident from:

This great multitude of white-robed palm-bearers,
must include those who, under the

was to be deferred the avenging of their blood
on those who dwell on the earth. That epoch
had now arrived; and they come forth arrayed
in the white robes then given them.
The palm-branches in their hands, are emblems
of victory. They symbolize the subjects
of the first resurrection, caught up to
meet the Lord in the air. That they are

smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, ascended
before God from the angel's hand. And the angel

The epoch of this seal, is sometimes regarded
as anterior to that of the trumpets; and those
are often supposed to be included in the events
of this seal; but no conclusive reason has ever
been given for removing it from its obvious
position as the closing one, of a series of successive
periods, commencing with the gospel,
and extending to the end of the world. If the
first six are successive in their respective order,
analogy would require that the seventh
be thus considered.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Under the sixth seal, the great men and
rich, are seen fleeing to the rocks for refuge
from the wrath of the Lamb; and the risen
saints symbolized, are in the Saviour's presence;
but the infliction of the wrath of God
on the wicked is not there symbolized. The
events of that seal come down as far as those
in the 19th chapter, which precede the marriage
of the Lamb, 19:7.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The half-hour's silence, is the first thing
indicated under the seventh seal. Being so
expressly noticed, it would seem to be of some
significance. As a period of symbolic time,
on the scale of a day for a year, <span class="tei tei-q">“about half
an hour,”</span> would equal a week's duration—corresponding
to the time which intervened
between the entrance of Noah into the ark,
and the commencement of the deluge, Gen.
7:1-4. As the period evidently synchronizes
with the parable of the Saviour, when
<span class="tei tei-q">“the Bridegroom came; and they that were
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page075">[pg 075]</span><a name="Pg075" id="Pg075" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
ready went in with him to the marriage, and
the door was shut”</span> (Matt. 25:10),—the others
being still without,—it would seem to
symbolize the time, between the entrance to
the marriage of the Lamb (19:7), and the
going forth of the Word of God with his armies,
to judge, make war, and to slay the
remnant with the sword, 19:11-21. It
would be a period of holy joy to the righteous
in the Saviour's presence, and of awful suspense
to the wicked.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The seven angels, to whom were given
seven trumpets, being introduced here, have
doubtless caused the events of this seal to be
regarded as anterior to the first trumpet. As
those immediately following, evidently synchronize
with occurrences of the closing epoch,
the angels can only be introduced here in anticipation
of the symbolization which they are
to unfold under the sounding of the successive
trumpets—the same as the seven angels with
the last plagues are introduced, before the
epoch of the commencement of their allotted
work, 15:1.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The golden censer was the instrument in
which incense was burned in the Jewish worship.
Incense symbolizes prayers (5:8).
The offering of much incense with the prayers
of all saints and the smoke of the incense ascending
up before God, indicates the acceptance
of their offerings in heaven—the act
being before the throne, and not on the earth.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page076">[pg 076]</span><a name="Pg076" id="Pg076" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
The acceptance of their prayers, also implies
their own acceptance, when presented <span class="tei tei-q">“faultless
before the presence of his glory with exceeding
joy,”</span> Jude 24.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The fire from the altar, symbolizes the instruments
of divine justice; and the filling the
censer with coals after the acceptance of the
saints, and the casting of both the censer and
fire to the earth, indicate that thenceforth
there would be no more acceptance of prayer
from those left on the earth, but the speedy
infliction of impending judgments.

The earth of the Apocalypse is regarded by
most expositors as the Roman empire, in a
state of comparative quiet. As no tornado
like this described has ever happened, its correspondence
must be sought for in the political
relations of the empire. There is great
unanimity among commentators respecting
the period and the agents here symbolized,—that
it refers to the invasions of the Goths and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page078">[pg 078]</span><a name="Pg078" id="Pg078" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
other barbarians, from A. D. 363 to 410. After
395, their incursions were more severe than
during the earlier portion of that period. The
third part of the earth, would be the third part
of the Roman empire, in distinction from the
other two-thirds.

(9:4), and must therefore symbolize the
people of God in the third part of the empire.
As all the green grass is burnt up,
while only one-third of the trees suffer, the
latter cannot include one-third of all the trees
in the empire, but only one-third in the parts
affected,—the grass indicating the more
weakly, and the trees the more hardy classes
of Christians.

The infidel historian, Gibbon, has given the
events which fitly correspond with the symbolization
of these trumpets. After the death
of Theodosius, in January, A. D. 395, Alaric,
the bold leader of the Gothic nation, took
arms against the empire. The terrible effects
of this invasion, are thus described:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The barbarian auxiliaries erected their independent
standard; and boldly avowed hostile
designs, which they had long cherished in
their ferocious minds. Their countrymen,
who had been condemned, by the conditions
of the last treaty, to a life of tranquillity and
labor, deserted their farms at the first sound
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page079">[pg 079]</span><a name="Pg079" id="Pg079" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the trumpet, and eagerly assumed the
weapons which they had reluctantly laid
down. The barriers of the Danube were
thrown open; the savage warriors of Scythia
issued from their forest; and the uncommon
severity of the winter, allowed the poet to remark,
that <span class="tei tei-q">‘they rolled their ponderous wagons
over the broad and icy back of the indignant
river.’</span> The unhappy nations of the
provinces to the south of the Danube, submitted
to the calamities, which, in the course
of twenty years, were almost grown familiar
to their imagination; and the various troops
of barbarians, who gloried in the Gothic name,
were irregularly spread from the woody
shores of Dalmatia, to the walls of Constantinople.
The Goths were directed by the bold
and artful genius of Alaric. In the midst of
a divided court, and a discontented people, the
emperor, Arcadius, was terrified by the aspect
of the Gothic arms. Alaric disdained to
trample any longer on the prostrate and
ruined countries of Thrace and Dacia, and he
resolved to seek a plentiful harvest of fame
and riches in a province which had hitherto
escaped the ravages of war.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Alaric traversed, without resistance, the
plains of Macedonia and Thessaly. The
troops which had been posted to defend
the Straits of Thermopylæ, retired, as they
were directed, without attempting to disturb
the secure and rapid passage of Alaric; and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page080">[pg 080]</span><a name="Pg080" id="Pg080" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the fertile fields of Phocis and Bœotia were
instantly covered with a deluge of barbarians,
who massacred the males of an age to bear
arms, and drove away the beautiful females,
with the spoil and cattle of the flaming villages.
The travellers who visited Greece
several years afterwards, could easily discover
the deep and bloody traces of the march of
the Goths. The whole territory of Attica
was blasted by his baneful presence; and if
we may use the comparison of a cotemporary
philosopher, Athens itself resembled the bleeding
and empty skin of a slaughtered victim.
Corinth, Argos, Sparta, yielded without resistance
to the arms of the Goths; and the most
fortunate of the inhabitants were saved, by
death, from beholding the slavery of their families,
and the conflagration of their cities.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Gibbon's

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Being tempted by the fame of Rome, Alaric
hastened to subjugate it. He put to flight the
Emperor of the West; but deliverance soon
came, and Rome was saved from his hands.
Alaric was first conquered in 403. But another
cloud was gathering, and is thus described
by Gibbon:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“About four years after the victorious
Toulan had assumed the title of Khan of the
Geougen, another barbarian, the haughty
Rhodogast, or Radagaisus, marched from the
northern extremities of Germany almost to
the gates of Rome, and left the remains of his
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page081">[pg 081]</span><a name="Pg081" id="Pg081" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
army to achieve the destruction of the West.
The Vandals, the Suevi, and the Burgundians,
formed the strength of this mighty host;
but the Alani, who had found a hospitable
reception in their new seats, added their active
cavalry to the heavy infantry of the Germans;
and the Gothic adventurers crowded so eagerly
to the standard of Radagaisus, that, by some
historians, he has been styled the King of the
Goths. Twelve thousand warriors, distinguished
above the vulgar by their noble birth,
or their valiant deeds, glittered in the van;
and the whole multitude, which was not less
than two hundred thousand fighting men,
might be increased by the accession of women,
of children, and of slaves, to the amount of
four hundred thousand persons.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The correspondence of nations was, in
that age, so imperfect and precarious, that the
revolutions of the North might escape the
knowledge of the court of Ravenna, till the
dark cloud, which was collected along the
coast of the Baltic, burst in thunder upon the
banks of the Upper Danube, &amp;c. Many cities
of Italy were pillaged or destroyed; and the
siege of Florence by Radagaisus, is one of the
earliest events in the history of that celebrated
republic, whose firmness checked or delayed
the unskilful fury of the barbarians.</span>

unconscious of the approaching calamities,
enjoyed a state of quiet and prosperity, which
had seldom blessed the frontiers of Gaul.
Their flocks and herds were permitted to
graze in the pastures of the barbarians: their
huntsmen penetrated, without fear or danger,
into the darkest recesses of the Hercynian
wood. The banks of the Rhine were crowded,
like those of the Tiber, with elegant houses
and well-cultivated farms; and if the poet descended
the river, he might express his doubt
on which side was situated the territory of the
Romans. This scene of peace and plenty was
suddenly changed into a desert; and the prospect
of the smoking ruins, could alone distinguish
the solitude of nature, from the desolation
of man. The flourishing city of Mentz
was surprised and destroyed; and many thousand
Christians were inhumanly massacred in
the church. Worms perished, after a long
and obstinate siege; Strasburg, Spires, Rheims,
Tournay, Arras, Amiens, experienced the
cruel oppression of the German yoke; and the
consuming flames of war spread from the
banks of the Rhine over the greatest part of
the seventeen provinces of Gaul. That rich
and extensive country, as far as the ocean,
the Alps, and the Pyrenees, was delivered to
the barbarians, who drove before them, in a
promiscuous crowd, the bishop, the senator,
and the virgin, laden with the spoils of their
houses and altars.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ibid.</span></span>, vol. v., p. 224.

After this invasion of the empire by Radagaisus,

As waters symbolize <span class="tei tei-q">“peoples, multitudes,
nations, and tongues,”</span> the sea into which the

The ships and fish in the sea, must necessarily
symbolize agents sustaining a relation to
the Roman Sea, analogous to the relation of

The symbol of a burning mountain fitly represents
the armed invaders under Genseric. In
the year 429, with fifty thousand effective
men he landed on the shores of Africa, established
an independent government in that
part of the Roman empire, and from thence,
harassed the southern shores of Europe and
the intermediate islands, by perpetual incursions.
Says Gibbon:—<span class="tei tei-q">“The Vandals, who,
in twenty years, had penetrated from the Elbe
to Mount Atlas, were united under the command
of their warlike king; and he reigned
with equal authority over the Alarici, who
had passed within the term of human life,
from the cold of Scythia, to the excessive heat
of an African climate.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The Vandals and Alarici, who followed
the successful standard of Genseric, had acquired
a rich and fertile territory, which
stretched along the coast from Tangiers to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page085">[pg 085]</span><a name="Pg085" id="Pg085" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Tripoli; but their narrow limits were pressed
and confined on either side by the sandy desert
and the Mediterranean. The discovery
and conquest of the black nations that might
dwell beneath the torrid zone, could not tempt
the rational ambition of Genseric; but he cast
his eyes towards the sea; he resolved to create
a new naval power, and his bold enterprise
was executed with steady and active perseverance.
The woods of Mount Atlas afforded
an inexhaustible nursery of timber; his new
subjects were skilled in the art of navigation
and ship-building; he animated his daring
Vandals to embrace a mode of warfare which
would render every maritime country accessible
to their arms; the Moors and Africans
were allured by the hope of plunder; and,
after an interval of six centuries, the fleet that
issued from the port of Carthage again claimed
the empire of the Mediterranean. The success
of the Vandals, the conquest of Sicily,
the sack of Palermo, and the frequent descents
on the coast of Lucania, awakened and
alarmed the mother of Valentinian, and the
sister of Theodosius.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The naval power of Rome was unequal
to the task of saving even the imperial city
from the ravages of the Vandals. Sailing
from Africa, they disembarked at the port of
Ostia, and Rome and its inhabitants were delivered
to the licentiousness of Vandals and
Moors, whose blind passions revenged the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page086">[pg 086]</span><a name="Pg086" id="Pg086" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
injuries of Carthage. The pillage lasted fourteen
days and nights; and all that yet remained
of public and private wealth, of
sacred or profane treasure, was diligently
transported to the vessels of Genseric. In
the forty-five years that had elapsed since
the Gothic invasion, the pomp and luxury of
Rome were in some measure restored; and it
was difficult either to escape, or to satisfy the
avarice of a conqueror, who possessed leisure
to collect, and ships to transport, the wealth
of the capital.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Gibbon.</span></span>

The sounding of the third trumpet marks
the advent of a third invader of the Roman
empire. And such was Attila, the king of the
Huns, who invaded Gaul A. D. 451. Gibbon
says:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The kings and nations of Germany and
Scythia, from the Volga perhaps to the Danube,
obeyed the warlike summons of Attila.
From the royal village in the plains of Hungary,
his standard moved towards the west;
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page087">[pg 087]</span><a name="Pg087" id="Pg087" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and, after a march of seven or eight hundred
miles, he reached the conflux of the Rhine
and the Necker.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“The hostile myriads
were poured with resistless violence into the
Belgic provinces.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“The consternation of
Gaul was universal.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“From the Rhine and
the Moselle, Attila advanced into the heart of
Gaul, crossed the Seine at Auxerre, and,
after a long and laborious march, fixed his
camp under the walls of Orleans.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“An alliance
was formed between the Romans and
Visigoths.”</span> The hostile armies approached.
<span class="tei tei-q">“ <span class="tei tei-q">‘I myself,’</span> said Attila, <span class="tei tei-q">‘will throw the
first javelin, and the wretch who refuses
to imitate the example of his sovereign, is devoted
to inevitable death.’</span> The spirit of the
barbarians was rekindled by the presence, the
voice, and the example, of their intrepid leader;
and Attila, yielding to their impatience, immediately
formed his order of battle. At the
head of his brave and faithful Huns, Attila
occupied, in person, the centre of the line.”</span>
The nations from the Volga to the Atlantic
were assembled on the plains of Chalons; and
there fought a battle, <span class="tei tei-q">“fierce, various, obstinate,
and bloody, such as could not be paralleled,
either in the present, or in past ages!
The number of the slain amounted to one
hundred and sixty-two thousand, or according
to another account, three hundred thousand
persons; and these incredible exaggerations
suppose a real or effective loss, sufficient to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page088">[pg 088]</span><a name="Pg088" id="Pg088" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
justify the historian's remark, that whole generations
may be swept away, by the madness
of kings, in the space of a single hour.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Attila was compelled to retreat; but neither
his forces nor reputation suffered. He
<span class="tei tei-q">“passed the Alps, invaded Italy, and besieged
Aquileia with an innumerable host of barbarians.”</span>
<span class="tei tei-q">“The succeeding generation could
scarcely discover the ruins of Aquileia. After
this dreadful chastisement, Attila pursued
his march; and, as he passed, the cities of
Altinum, Concordia, and Padua were reduced
into heaps of stones and ashes. The inland
towns, Vicenza, Verona, and Bergamo, were
exposed to the rapacious cruelty of the Huns.
Milan and Pavia submitted, without resistance,
to the loss of their wealth;”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“applauded
the unusual clemency which preserved
from the flames the public as well as private
buildings, and spared the lives of the captive
multitude.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Attila spread his ravages over
the rich plains of modern Lombardy; which
are divided by the Po, and bounded by the
Alps and Apennines.”</span> He took possession of
the royal palace of Milan. <span class="tei tei-q">“It is a saying
worthy of the ferocious pride of Attila, that
the grass never grew on the spot where his
horse had trod.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He advanced into Italy, only as far as the
plains of Lombardy and the banks of the Po,
reducing the cities he passed to stones and
ashes; but there his ravages ceased. He concluded
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page089">[pg 089]</span><a name="Pg089" id="Pg089" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
a peace with the Romans in the year
of his invasion of Italy (451), and the next
year he died. Thus he appeared like a fiery
meteor, exerted his appointed influence upon
the tongues and people, who were tributary
to the Romans,—as rivers and fountains of
waters are to the sea; and like a burning
star, he as suddenly expired. As a specimen
of the bitterness which followed his course, it
is recorded of the Thuringians who served in
his army, and who traversed, both in their
march and in their return, the territories of
the Franks, <span class="tei tei-q">“that they massacred their hostages
as well as their captives. Two hundred
young maidens were tortured with exquisite
and unrelenting rage; their bodies were torn
asunder by wild horses, or were crushed under
the weight of rolling wagons; and their unburied
limbs were abandoned on public roads,
as a prey to dogs and vultures.”</span>

The sun, moon, and stars cannot here, any

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page090">[pg 090]</span><a name="Pg090" id="Pg090" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
represent the rulers of the Roman empire.
Says Dr. Keith:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“At the voice of the first angel, and the
blast of his trumpet, the whole Roman world
was in agitation, and <span class="tei tei-q">‘the storms of war’</span>
passed over it all. <span class="tei tei-q">‘The union of the empire
was dissolved;’</span> a third part of it fell; and the
<span class="tei tei-q">‘transalpine provinces were separated from
the empire.’</span> Under the second trumpet, the
provinces of Africa, another, or the maritime,
part, was in like manner reft from Rome, and
the Roman ships were destroyed in the sea,
and even in their harbors. The empire of
Rome, hemmed in on every side, was then
limited to the kingdom of Italy. Within its
bounds, and along the fountains and rivers of
waters, the third trumpet reëchoed from the
Alps to the Apennines. The last barrier of
the empire of Rome was broken. The plains
of Lombardy were ravaged by a foreign foe:
and from thence new enemies arose to bring
to an end the strife of the world with the imperial
city.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“ <span class="tei tei-q">‘In the space of twenty years since the

history of mankind.’</span> ”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The throne of the Cæsars had been for
ages the sun of the world; while other kings
were designated as stars. The imperial power
had first been transferred to Constantinople by
Constantine; and it was afterwards divided
between the east and the west; but the eastern
empire was not yet doomed to destruction.
The precise year in which the western empire
was extinguished, is not positively ascertained,
but it is usually assigned to A. D. 476. Some
place it in 479. The imperial Roman power, of
which either Rome or Constantinople had been
jointly or singly the seat, whether in the West
or the East, ceased to be recognized in Italy;
and the third part of the sun was smitten, till
it emitted no longer the faintest rays. The
power of the Cæsars became unknown in
Italy; and a Gothic king reigned over Rome.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Dr. Keith considers that <span class="tei tei-q">“the concluding
words of the fourth trumpet imply the future
restoration of the Western empire: <span class="tei tei-q">‘The day
shone not for a third part of it, and the
night likewise.’</span> In respect to civil authority,
Rome became subject to Ravenna; and Italy
was a conquered province of the Eastern empire.
But, as more appropriately pertaining
to other prophecies, the defence of the worship
of images first brought the spiritual and temporal
powers of the Pope and of the emperor
into violent collision; and, by conferring on
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page092">[pg 092]</span><a name="Pg092" id="Pg092" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the Pope all authority over the churches, Justinian
laid his helping hand to the promotion
of the papal supremacy, which afterwards assumed
the power of creating monarchs. In
the year of our Lord 800, the Pope conferred
on Charlemagne the title of Emperor of the
Romans. The title was again transferred from
the King of France to the Emperor of Germany.
By the latter it was formally renounced,
within the memory of the existing generation.
In our own days the iron crown of Italy was
on the head of another <span class="tei tei-q">‘emperor.’</span> ”</span> Then
the sun was suddenly darkened, as symbolized
under the sixth seal, 6:12. p. 66.

The word eagle, instead of angel, is in accordance
with the more recent revised editions
of the Greek. It must symbolize persons peculiarly
apprehensive at this crisis, of disasters
to follow the extinction of the Roman
empire in the west. During the first half of
the sixth century, the Sclavonians invaded the
east, <span class="tei tei-q">“spread from the suburbs of Constantinople

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The locusts were generated in the smoke
from whence they issued. In a corresponding

in the organization of hordes of Saracens,

Arabian empire, which extended from the
Atlantic ocean to the river Euphrates.

Their crowns, faces, hair, teeth, breast-plates,

appearance: on their heads they wore
yellow turbans, like coronets; their demeanor

At this epoch, the Greek church at Constantinople
had been preserved from the reproach
of image worship, and still later it
made strenuous efforts against it; but the
churches of the north of Africa, and the Asiatic
portion of the Eastern empire, had become
greatly debased, and worshipped saints and
images. And while the territories of these
were speedily subverted to Mohammedanism,
and became a part of the Arabian empire, the
east of Europe was wonderfully preserved
from their inroads.

The time of this torment was limited to five

was no longer progressive; the proud Saracen
empire became dismembered, and three independent
and hostile Caliphates, and several
fragments of kingdoms, were formed from its
ruins. In 841, the reigning Caliph at Bagdad,
distrusting the spirit of his own troops, hired
a body of fifty thousand Turkish soldiers,
which he distributed in his dominions. These
accelerated the ruin of the Caliphate, and, in
time, the whole of the Saracen territory became
subject to the Tartar rule, which had
become Mohammedan, and also aimed to subject
the eastern empire.

of the eleventh century, under Togrul Beg.</span>
He suddenly overran, with myriads of cavalry,
the frontier, from Taurus to Arzeroum,
and spread it with blood and devastation.
Alp Arslan, his successor, soon renewed the
invasion, conquered Armenia and Georgia,
penetrated into Cappadocia and Phrygia, and
scattered detachments over the whole of lesser
Asia. His troops being subsequently driven
back, he renewed the war, and recovered
those provinces. His descendants, and others
of the race, soon after extended their conquests,
and established the kingdoms in the
east of Persia and Syria, and Roum, in lesser
Asia, which they maintained through many
generations, and made their sway a scorpion
scourge to the idolatrous inhabitants. The
Christians were allowed the exercise of their
religion on the conditions of tribute and servitude,
but were compelled to endure the scorn
of the victors, to submit to the abuse of their
priests and bishops, and to witness the apostasy
of their brethren, the compulsory circumcision
of many thousands of their children,
and the subjection of many thousands to
a debasing and hopeless slavery.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In 1449 Constantine Deacoses, being entitled
to the throne of Constantinople by the
death of John Paleologus, did not venture to
take possession till he had sent ambassadors
and gained the consent of Amurath, the Turkish
Sultan. From this fact, Ducas, the historian,
counts Paleologus as the last Greek
emperor—for he did not consider as such, a
prince who did not dare to reign without permission
of his enemy. Amurath died and
was succeeded in the empire, in 1451, by
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Mahomet II.</span></span>, who set his heart on Constantinople,
and made preparations for besieging
the city. The siege commenced on the 6th
of April, 1453, and ended in the taking of the
city, and death of the last of the Constantines,
on the 16th of May following, when the
eastern city of the Cæsars became the seat of
the Ottoman empire; and its <span class="tei tei-q">“religion was
trampled in the dust by the Moslem conquerors.”</span>
Thus the two-horned beast (13:11),
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page103">[pg 103]</span><a name="Pg103" id="Pg103" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The description of the horses, and those
who sat on them (v. 17), is strikingly emblematic
of the Turkish warriors who subjugated
Constantinople. Says Dr. Keith:
<span class="tei tei-q">“The breast-plates of the horsemen, in reference
to the more destructive implements of
war, might then, for the first time, be said to
be fire, and jacinth, and brimstone. The
musket had recently supplied the place of the
bow. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Fire</span></span> emanated from their breasts.
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Brimstone</span></span>, the flame of which is <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">jacinth</span></span>,
was an ingredient both of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">liquid fire</span></span> and of
gunpowder.... A new mode of warfare
was at that time introduced, which has
changed the nature of war itself, in regard to
the form of its instrument of destruction; and
sounds and sights unheard of and unknown
before, were the death-knell and doom of the
Roman empire. Invention outrivalled force,
and a new power was introduced, that of
musketry as well as of artillery, in the art of
war, before which the old Macedonian phalanx
would not have remained unbroken, nor
the Roman legions stood. That which <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">John</span></span>
saw <span class="tei tei-q">‘in the vision,’</span> is read in the history of
the times.”</span>

By these three, the fire, smoke, and brimstone,
were the third part of men killed (v.
18), and by these was the conquest of Constantinople
effected. Says Gibbon: <span class="tei tei-q">“At the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page104">[pg 104]</span><a name="Pg104" id="Pg104" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
request of Mahomet II., Urban produced a
piece of brass ordnance of stupendous and
almost incredible magnitude. A measure of
twelve palms was assigned to the bore, and
the stone bullet weighed about six hundred
pounds. A vacant place before the new palace
was chosen for the first experiment; but
to prevent the sudden and mischievous effects
of astonishment and fear, a proclamation was
issued that the cannon would be discharged
the ensuing day. The explosion was felt or
heard in a circuit of a hundred furlongs; the
ball, by the force of the gunpowder, was driven
about a mile, and on the spot where it fell,
it buried itself a fathom deep in the ground.
For the conveyance of this destructive engine,
a frame or carriage of thirty wagons was
linked together, and drawn along by a train
of sixty oxen; two hundred men, on both
sides, were stationed to poise or support the
rolling weight; two hundred and fifty workmen
marched before to smooth the way and
repair the bridges, and near two months were
employed in a laborious journey of a hundred
and fifty miles.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“In the siege, the incessant volleys of
lances and arrows were accompanied with the
smoke, the sound, and the fire of their musketry
and cannon. Their small arms discharged
at the same time five or even ten
balls of lead of the size of a walnut, and according
to the closeness of the ranks, and the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page105">[pg 105]</span><a name="Pg105" id="Pg105" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
force of the powder, several breast-plates and
bodies were transpierced by the same shot.
But the Turkish approaches were soon sunk
into trenches, or covered with ruins. Each
day added to the science of the Christians,
but their inadequate stock of gunpowder
was wasted in the operation of each day.
Their ordnance was not powerful either in
size or number, and if they possessed some
heavy cannon, they feared to plant them on
the walls, lest the aged structure should be
shaken and overthrown by the explosion.
The same destructive secret had been revealed
to the Moslems, by whom it was employed
with the superior energy of zeal, riches, and
despotism. The great cannon of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Mahomet</span></span>
was flanked by two fellows almost of equal
magnitude: the long order of the Turkish
artillery was pointed against the walls: fourteen
batteries thundered at once on the most
accessible places, and of one of these it is ambiguously
expressed that it was mounted with
one hundred and thirty guns, or that it discharged
one hundred and thirty bullets.”</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The conquest of Constantinople being accomplished,
they were to have power to kill
men during an hour, day, month, and year
of prophetic time—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> three hundred and
ninety-one years, fifteen days. If reckoned
from the conquest of the city, this would extend
to June 1844. Whether any particular
act has transpired to mark the precise point
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page106">[pg 106]</span><a name="Pg106" id="Pg106" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of its termination, may not be important; but
it is interesting to consider that within a
few years the Mohammedan government has
formally granted permission for the full enjoyment
of the Protestant religion; and has
renounced the right of punishing by death,
apostates from Islamism.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In August 1843, an Armenian, who had
become a Mussulman and subsequently returned
to the religion of his fathers, was beheaded
at Constantinople. The Christian
powers of Europe immediately remonstrated,
and it was hoped that the law against apostates
from Mohammedanism would be permitted
to become a dead letter. In a few
months, however, a firman issued from the
government ordering the decapitation of a
young man near Brooza, who was put to
death for having promised in a passion, but
had afterwards refused, to become a Mohammedan.
Lord Aberdeen, the British Secretary
of Foreign Affairs, then demanded of the
Turkish Sultan that the Porte should not
insult and trample on Christianity, <span class="tei tei-q">“by treating
as a criminal any person who embraces
it;”</span> but should <span class="tei tei-q">“renounce, absolutely and
without equivocation, the barbarous practice
which has called forth the remonstrance now
addressed to it.”</span> To this communication the
following answer was made early in 1844:
<span class="tei tei-q">“The Sublime Porte engages to take effectual
measures to prevent, henceforward, the execution
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page107">[pg 107]</span><a name="Pg107" id="Pg107" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and putting to death of the Christian
who is an apostate.”</span> On the 15th of November,
1847, for the first time, a firman was
issued recognizing Protestant Christians as a
distinct community, forbidding any molestation
or interference <span class="tei tei-q">“in their temporal or
spiritual concerns,”</span> and permitting them <span class="tei tei-q">“to
exercise the profession of their creed in security.”</span>
This coming from the Vizier, did
not necessarily survive a change of ministry;
but in November, 1850, a firman was issued
from the Sultan himself, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">establishing</span></em> the policy
of the empire in respect to Protestants, and
confirming them in all needed civil and religious
privileges. Thus has the Mohammedan
government formally and forever renounced
the power it had so long wielded, of causing
spiritual death by compelling men to apostatize
from Christianity.

The rest of the men not killed, must be

event, the time of which was <span class="tei tei-q">“not yet,”</span>—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
under the sixth trumpet, was the coming of
the kingdom of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span></span>—the fifth universal empire;
that at a period anterior to the time
when it might rationally be expected, it would
be proclaimed in a form repugnant to the
teachings of the prophets; and that when thus
heralded, it would be met by the party uttering
the heaven-inspired truths, with the denial
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page111">[pg 111]</span><a name="Pg111" id="Pg111" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that the time had arrived, and by arguments
to show its true nature and epoch, under the
seventh trumpet.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The command to take and eat the little
book, shows that its contents were such as the
soul might feed on; which should be sweet to
the believer's taste, but would subject him to
bitter persecution. And the announcement
that they were to prophesy <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">again</span></em> before many
nations and peoples and tongues and kings,
marks this as the commencement of an era
when the Gospel should again begin to go
forth into distant lands.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
All of the above particulars harmonize in
the time of the reformation of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Luther</span></span> in the
sixteenth century, and with no other epoch.
The great truths then promulgated, of which
<span class="tei tei-q">“justification by faith”</span> was the cardinal one,
electrified the whole world, as the loud roaring
of a lion would startle the passer-by.
These were immediately responded to by the
multitudinous errors of the Anabaptists and
others, who thought to set up the kingdom of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span></span> in
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">this world</span></em>, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">before the resurrection</span></em>,
by putting to death the ungodly and sparing
only the saints.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As in all efforts for good Satan is careful to
attempt a counterfeit, or to mingle impure
elements to the injury of the truth, so in
the Reformation there were false reformers.
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Thomas Munzer</span></span>, and others, in 1525, incited
vast numbers on the borders of the Danube to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page112">[pg 112]</span><a name="Pg112" id="Pg112" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
make physical war on the Papal ecclesiastics.
He denounced <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Luther</span></span>, also, with the same
violence that he did the Pope. In his mad
attempt to slay the ungodly, he took possession
of Muhlhausen, appointed a new city
council, pillaged the houses of the rich, proclaimed
a community of goods, and committed
various excesses; but they were finally defeated
in a pitched battle, with a loss of from
five thousand to seven thousand killed. Others
succeeded him, teaching that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span></span> spake to them
in person, instructing them how to act. They
professed the most extravagant doctrines, setting
aside both <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Luther</span></span> and the Bible. The
former did not go near far enough for them;
and the latter was in their view insufficient
for man's instruction, who could only be
taught of God. They taught that the world
was to be immediately devastated; and no
priest or ungodly person be left alive; and
that then the kingdom of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span></span> would commence,
and the saints possess the earth.
Those who adhered to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Luther</span></span>, united with
him in bearing a faithful testimony against
such extravagances, adhered to the written
word, denounced new revelations, and showed
from the Bible that Antichrist was to be overthrown
by the personal advent of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Christ</span></span>, and
not by the sword of man. The following
extracts are from <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Mr. Lord</span></span>:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The pretences of the Anabaptists to inspiration
were in like manner denounced by
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page113">[pg 113]</span><a name="Pg113" id="Pg113" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Melancthon. <span class="tei tei-q">‘The Anabaptists, infatuated by
the devil, have boasted a new species of
sanctity, as though they had left the earth,
and ascended to the skies; and given out,
moreover, that they enjoy extraordinary inspiration.
But as the pretence was hypocritical,
and designed merely to subserve appetite
and ambition, they soon plunged into debauchery,
and then excited seditions, and undertook
to establish a New Jerusalem, as other enthusiasts
have often attempted. A like tragedy
was formerly acted at Pepuza in Phrygia,
which fanatical prophets denominated the
new Jerusalem.’</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“He also refuted by the Scriptures, the
expectation of the Anabaptists of the immediate
establishment of Christ's millennial kingdom.
He regarded the term Antichrist as
denoting both the Mohammedan empire and
the Papacy, and held that they were not to be
overthrown till the time of the resurrection of
the dead, and that a considerable period was
to pass before that event. <span class="tei tei-q">‘God showed to
Daniel a series of monarchies and kingdoms,
which it is certain has already run to the end.
Four monarchies have passed away. The
cruel kingdom of the Turks, which arose out
of the fourth, still remains, and as it is not to
equal the Roman in power, and has certainly,
therefore, already nearly reached its height,
must soon decline, and then will dawn the
day in which the dead shall be recalled to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page114">[pg 114]</span><a name="Pg114" id="Pg114" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
life.’</span> He then repeats the saying ascribed to
Elias, that six thousand years were to pass
before the advent of Christ; two thousand
before the law, two under the law, and two
under the gospel; and proceeds to show that
four hundred and fifty-eight years were,
therefore, to intervene before the advent of
the Redeemer, the destruction of Antichrist,
and the establishment of the kingdom of the
saints. <span class="tei tei-q">‘It is known that Christ was born
about the end of the fourth millenary,<a id="noteref_1" name="noteref_1" href="#note_1"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1</span></span></a> and
one thousand five hundred and forty-two
years have since revolved. We are not,
therefore [in 1542], far from the end.’</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“These views corresponding so conspicuously
with the symbol, continued to be repeated by
a crowd of writers, till at the distance of sixty-seven
years from the death of Melancthon,
the celebrated Joseph Mede published his
<span class="tei tei-q">‘Clavis Apocalyptica,’</span> in which he showed
from the coincidence of the periods of the
wild beast and the witnesses, that the advent
of the Redeemer, and the destruction of the
anti-Christian powers were not to be expected
until twelve hundred and sixty years had
passed from the rise of the ten kingdoms, and
that near one hundred of them, therefore, were
still to revolve. As that period expired and
the knowledge of the prophecy advanced, the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page115">[pg 115]</span><a name="Pg115" id="Pg115" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
catastrophe of the wild beast was referred to
a later time. Many recent expositors regard
the twelve hundred and sixty years as having
reached their end in 1792; and most refer the
fall of the anti-Christian powers to the last
half of the present, or the beginning of the
next century.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ex. of Apoc.</span></span>, pp. 238-240.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
All the vagaries of the various sects of
heretics were connected with an expectation
of the immediate establishment of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Christ's</span></span>
kingdom. That the seven thunders gave
utterance to such an expectation, is evident
from the response of the angel, when he lifted
up his hand to heaven and with the solemnity
of an oath, by Him who liveth forever,
affirmed that <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the time should not yet be</span></em>;”</span>
but that <span class="tei tei-q">“in the days of the voice of the
seventh angel, when he delays to sound,<a id="noteref_2" name="noteref_2" href="#note_2"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2</span></span></a> the
secret of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span></span> will be finished, as he hath
announced to his servants the prophets.”</span>
Why such an annunciation at this stage of
the vision? It must be to correct a misapprehension
which would exist at a corresponding
time in its fulfilment, respecting the
immediate appearance of the kingdom. Thus
did <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Paul</span></span> correct the Thessalonian brethren,
when he wrote to them in his second epistle
not to be shaken in mind, as that the day of
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span></span> was then impending, 2 Th. 2:2.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Bible, was, at this epoch, first opened
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page116">[pg 116]</span><a name="Pg116" id="Pg116" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to the common people. Before, it was only
found in languages which they were entirely
ignorant of. It was translated by <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Luther</span></span> into
their own language, and thus made accessible.
The art of printing, discovered at about
that time, enabled all who wished, to avail
themselves of its unsealed contents. They
feasted on the words of inspiration, which
were sweeter to them than honey, or the honey-comb.
But afterwards, they had to endure bitterness
for the sake of the Gospel. Divisions
and subdivisions followed, parties multiplied,
and heresies abounded, accompanied
with bitter and mischievous discussions, and
fierce and rancorous contentions. These being
based on the understanding which the several
parties attached to portions of scripture, were
fitly symbolized by the bitterness that followed
the eating of the book. At this time,
also, was revived a system of religious teachings
which has gone forth into many lands.

These symbols are evidently taken from
the temple and altar of Jewish worship, and
represent corresponding analogies under the
Christian dispensation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To measure anything, is to examine and
take notice of its parts and proportions; and
that by which it is measured, is the standard
or rule to which it should conform.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The temple, is a proper symbol of the
church of God; which is <span class="tei tei-q">“built upon the
foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus
Christ himself being the Chief Corner Stone,
in whom all the building, fitly framed together,
groweth unto a holy temple in the Lord,”</span>
Eph. 2:20, 21.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At the epoch of the Reformation, the nominal
church was subjected to the scrutiny of
the word of God; and its pretensions were
measured by the scriptural rule. The reformers
found the Man of Sin, <span class="tei tei-q">“as God sitting
in the temple of God,”</span> (2 Thess. 2:4);
and they had to re-model their church relationship,
in accordance with the pattern presented
in the New Testament. This involved
the consideration of what constituted the
church,—its organization, its ministry, its
sacraments, and its membership,—their mutual
relation to God, and to each other.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The altar, must symbolize the sacrifice
and atonement of Christ,—the <span class="tei tei-q">“altar whereof
they have no right to eat which serve the
tabernacle,”</span> Heb. 13:10. The great question,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page118">[pg 118]</span><a name="Pg118" id="Pg118" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of justification by faith in the death of
Christ, was the rallying cry of the Reformation.
The fundamental principles of Christian
truth were then unfolded anew, and the
doctrines of the Papacy, including the sacrifice
of the mass, were rejected as contrary to
Bible teachings.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The worshippers in the temple, who were to
be measured by the same rule, are Christians.
All who were to be recognized as such, were
to give evidence of conformity to the Bible
standard. Regeneration by the Holy Ghost,
was held by the reformers to be necessary to
church membership. The Papists required
only baptism and confirmation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The court without the temple, was that to
which the Gentiles had access, and beyond
which their entrance was prohibited. Devout
foreigners were there permitted to pay their
devotions to the God of heaven. As the
Gentiles must symbolize those who are not
Christians, the occupants of the outer court,
must be the congregation—the nominal worshippers
who throng the outer courts of the
Lord, in distinction from the true worshippers.
Such were to have free and unrestricted access
to the places of Christian worship.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The holy city is that in which the temple is
situated, and must embrace the church as a
whole, subjected to Gentile rule. Its being
trodden under foot, indicates that the civil
polity under which the church would subsist,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page119">[pg 119]</span><a name="Pg119" id="Pg119" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
should, during the period specified, be under
the control of those who worship only in the
outer court.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The forty and two months, is a period of
time, corresponding with the thousand two
hundred and three score days of the verse
following, the time and times and half a time
of Rev. 12:14, and the corresponding periods
of Rev. 12:6; 13:5; Dan. 7:25; and 12:7;
symbolizing a period of twelve hundred and
sixty years, according to the almost unanimous
opinion of Protestant writers.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This period does not commence with this
epoch, but began with the subjection of Christianity
to the power of the civil arm, which
was to continue during the time predicted,—notwithstanding
the reädjustment of the temple-worship,—when
Christians should cease
to be responsible to any human tribunal for
the orthodoxy of their faith.

two prophets tormented those, who dwell on the earth.
And after the three days and a half the Spirit of life from
God entered them, and they stood on their feet; and great
fear fell on those, who saw them. And they heard a great
voice from heaven, saying to them, Ascend here! And
they ascended into heaven in a cloud; and their enemies
saw them. And in that hour there was a great earthquake,
and the tenth part of the city fell, and in the
earthquake seven thousand names of men were slain: and
the remnant became terrified, and gave glory to the God
of heaven. The second woe is past away; behold, the third
woe cometh quickly.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">—Rev. 11:3-14.

The two witnesses are not symbolically
exhibited, but are referred to by an elliptical
metaphor, and are explained to be the
<span class="tei tei-q">“two olive-trees, and the two candlesticks.”</span>
Therefore, they are not two living men, as
some suppose, shown to John in vision, symbolizing
analogous agents; but their nature is
to be determined by a consideration of the
olive-trees and candlesticks which symbolize
them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Candlesticks symbolize churches. Thus
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page121">[pg 121]</span><a name="Pg121" id="Pg121" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the Saviour said to John: <span class="tei tei-q">“The seven candlesticks
which thou sawest are the seven
churches,”</span> 1:20. When <span class="tei tei-q">“men light a candle,”</span>
they put <span class="tei tei-q">“it on a candlestick, and it
giveth light unto all that are in the house,”</span>
Matt. 5:15. The candlestick does not originate,
but sustains the light in a position to be
seen and exert a beneficial influence. It is
thus that the church is said to be <span class="tei tei-q">“the light
of the world,”</span> and is required to let her light
<span class="tei tei-q">“shine before men,”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ib.</span></span>
vs. 14-16,—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>
She is to disseminate the light committed to
her; and in so doing, she becomes a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">witness</span></em> for
Jesus.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The church comprises all the holy persons
who have lived on earth, and is symbolized
by two candlesticks, corresponding to the two
dispensations of its existence. Those who
lived under the former dispensation, are called
<span class="tei tei-q">“a great cloud of witnesses,”</span> Heb. 12:1.
Of Christ, <span class="tei tei-q">“give all the prophets witness,”</span>
Acts 10:43. They constitute the voice of
the church in that age. Under the gospel
dispensation, also, Christ had chosen witnesses
of himself. He said to his disciples,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Ye shall be witnesses unto me, both in
Jerusalem and in all Judea, and in Samaria,
and unto the uttermost parts of the earth,”</span>
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ib.</span></span> 1:8); and they said, <span class="tei tei-q">“We are his witnesses,”</span>
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ib.</span></span> 5:32. <span class="tei tei-q">“We are witnesses of
all things which he did, ... witnesses
chosen before of God,”</span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ib.</span></span> 10:39-41);—<span class="tei tei-q">“his
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page122">[pg 122]</span><a name="Pg122" id="Pg122" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
witnesses unto the people,”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ib.</span></span> 13:31.
They and their successors have <span class="tei tei-q">“testified and
preached the word of the Lord,”</span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ib.</span></span> 8:25),
overcoming <span class="tei tei-q">“by the word of their testimony,”</span>
(Rev. 12:11),—many of them being <span class="tei tei-q">“slain
for the word of God, and for the testimony
which they held,”</span> 6:9. The church, one in
all ages, symbolized by the two candlesticks,
is thus a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">witness</span></em> of Jesus.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The two olive-trees, symbolize the other
witness, which must sustain a relation to the
church, analogous to that sustained by the
olive-trees to the candlesticks. The declaration,
that the witnesses are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the</span></em> two olive-trees
and candlesticks, implies the existence of some
previous symbolization, where those objects
and their relation to each other are presented.
And the connection shows clearly that reference
is made to the vision, wherein Zechariah
beheld <span class="tei tei-q">“a candlestick all of gold, with a bowl
upon the top of it, and his seven lamps thereon,
and seven pipes to the seven lamps, which
are upon the top thereof; and two olive-trees
by it, one upon the right side of the bowl, and
the other upon the left side thereof,”</span> Zech.
4:2, 3. The relation which the olive-trees
sustain to the candlestick, is shown by the
questions of the prophet: <span class="tei tei-q">“What are these,
my Lord?”</span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ib.</span></span> v. 4); <span class="tei tei-q">“What are these
two olive-trees upon the right side of the
candlestick and upon the left side thereof?
What be these two olive-branches which
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page123">[pg 123]</span><a name="Pg123" id="Pg123" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
through the two golden pipes empty the
golden oil out of themselves?”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ib.</span></span> vs. 11, 12.
The office of the olive-trees, was to supply
the candlestick with oil which alone enabled
them to give light. The oil of the olive-tree,
was burned before the Lord continually.
The light committed to the church, is the
truth of God's word. And thus the angel
explains the meaning of the olive-trees:
<span class="tei tei-q">“This is the word of the Lord unto Zerubbabel,”</span>
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ib.</span></span> v. 6); <span class="tei tei-q">“These are the two
anointed ones [<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">mar</span></span>, sons of oil], that stand
by the Lord of the whole earth,”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ib.</span></span> v. 14.
And this expression, corresponding with that
in Rev. 11:4, shows that this vision of
Zechariah is the one referred to, and that it is
explanatory of the witnesses.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Scriptures, as well as the church,
testify of Christ: <span class="tei tei-q">“Search the Scriptures,”</span>
said the Saviour, speaking of those then
written; <span class="tei tei-q">“they are they which <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">testify</span></em> [or
bear witness] of me,”</span> (John 5:39); and
of the New Testament, he said: <span class="tei tei-q">“This gospel
of the kingdom shall be preached in all
the world for a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">witness</span></em> unto all nations,”</span>
Matt. 24:4. Like two olive-trees supplying
the candlesticks with oil, the Scriptures of the
Old, and of the New Testament give light
to the church, and testify of Christ. They
stand on either side of him,—the one beginning
with the creation and pointing to a
Messiah to come, testifying of him by types
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page124">[pg 124]</span><a name="Pg124" id="Pg124" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and shadows; and the other looking back to
the death and resurrection of Christ, and
cheering the heart of the believer by the evidence
of his second coming at the end of the
world. Thus stood within the oracle of the
temple the two cherubim, which Solomon
made <span class="tei tei-q">“of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">olive-tree</span></em>,”</span> and whose wings met
over the ark of the covenant: <span class="tei tei-q">“He set the
cherubim within the inner house, and they
stretched forth the wings of the cherubim,
so that the wing of the one touched the one
wall, and the wing of the other cherub
touched the other wall; and their wings
touched one another in the midst of the
house,”</span> 1 Kings 6, 27. Thus symbolized, the
Scriptures and the church are Christ's two
witnesses.

To prophesy, is to make known the truths
of God. Thus, at the epoch of the Reformation,
they were to prophesy <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">again</span></em> before
many peoples, and nations, and tongues and

The one thousand two hundred and sixty

34. And to Ezekiel, <span class="tei tei-q">“This shall be a
sign to the house of Israel: Lie thou upon

This period of one thousand two hundred
and sixty years, is not the whole time in
which the witnesses prophesy, but marks the
duration of their prophesying in sackcloth.
It commenced when the light of the Bible
began to be obscured by the secondary place
which was accorded to it in the estimation of
the Papal church, and the living witnesses
were no longer permitted to preach the gospel
in its purity.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In A. D. 533, the Emperor Justinian,
wrote a letter to the Pope declaring him to be
<span class="tei tei-q">“the head of all the holy churches,”</span> and
subjecting to his control <span class="tei tei-q">“all the priests of
the whole East.”</span> By the edicts and mandates
of Justinian, who was master of the Roman
world, the supremacy of the Pope received
the fullest sanction; and the highest authorities
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page126">[pg 126]</span><a name="Pg126" id="Pg126" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
among the civilians and annalists of
Rome, refer to these as evidence of the
right of the Pope to the title of <span class="tei tei-q">“Universal
Bishop,”</span> and date it from A. D. 533. p. <a href="#Pg200" class="tei tei-ref">200</a>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
With this supremacy, the power of the
Papacy commenced. The Bible was permitted
only in a dead language, and the
faithful Christian was obliged to seek refuge
in the wilderness. False doctrines obscuring
the Bible, and persecuting enactments oppressing
the church, clothed the witnesses in sackcloth;
and thus only did they testify, till the
power of the papacy was broken.
</p>

Fire proceeded out of their mouth, when
they made known the fiery judgments predicted
in the Scriptures against all their
enemies. And they shut heaven, smite with

the predictions which, in various places,
are thus symbolized.—See Rev. 15:6; 16:4,

The beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless
pit, is that on which, in a subsequent
vision, the woman is seated, 17:7, 8. John
saw this beast arise out of the sea, (13:1);
and the subsequent exposition given of it, will
show that it symbolized the civil power of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page127">[pg 127]</span><a name="Pg127" id="Pg127" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Roman empire in its divided form.—See p.

what is done by any of these kingdoms, is

more prominent of these kingdoms, and at one

portion of the whole.

To kill, when used symbolically and applied

The great city, as shown in connection with
Rev. 16:19, p. 290, is the Roman hierarchy:—symbolized
by Babylon, and <span class="tei tei-q">“spiritually
called Sodom and Egypt.”</span> By being thus
<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">spiritually</span></em> called Sodom,”</span> some understand
that it is a <span class="tei tei-q">“spiritual Sodom,”</span> &amp;c., which
would be a contradiction of terms; others
understand that it is called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">figuratively</span></em> by
those names, and deduce from it an argument
for spiritualizing the Scriptures; but the use of
the word <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">spiritually</span></em>,”</span> it is believed, will not
sanction any such meaning. It occurs only
in two other passages:—in Rom. 8:7, to be
<span class="tei tei-q">“spiritually minded,”</span> is to have a mind in
accordance with the will of the Spirit; and in
1 Cor. 2:14, things <span class="tei tei-q">“spiritually discerned,”</span>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page128">[pg 128]</span><a name="Pg128" id="Pg128" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
signifies that they are discerned by the aid of
the Spirit. The great city, then, is called by
the Spirit, <span class="tei tei-q">“Sodom and Egypt;”</span> and is so
called because of her licentiousness and idolatries,
and her subjecting the saints to bondage.
To crucify the Lord afresh, is to apostatize
from his teachings, Heb. 6:6.

In 1793, twelve hundred and sixty years
from the date of the Papal supremacy, the
Bible was abolished in France, by the solemn
decree of the government, which declared that
the nation acknowledged no God. A copy of
the Bible could not be found in a single bookstore
in Paris. Inquiry also was made for it in
Rome, in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></em> the book establishments of that
city, and the invariable reply was, that it was
prohibited. All the churches of Paris were
shut, and the church plate was declared the
property of the nation. Professors of religion,
at the same time, in large numbers openly
apostatized and embraced infidelity. Says
Dr. Croley:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“On the 1st of November, 1793, Gobet,
with the republican priests of Paris, had
thrown off the gown and abjured religion.
On the 11th, a <span class="tei tei-q">‘grand festival,’</span> dedicated to
<span class="tei tei-q">‘Reason and Truth,’</span> was celebrated instead
of divine service in the ancient cathedral of
Notre Dame, which had been desecrated, and
been named, <span class="tei tei-q">‘the Temple of Reason;’</span> a pyramid
was erected in the centre of the church,
surmounted by a temple, inscribed, <span class="tei tei-q">‘To Philosophy.’</span>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page129">[pg 129]</span><a name="Pg129" id="Pg129" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
The torch of <span class="tei tei-q">‘Truth’</span> was on the
altar of <span class="tei tei-q">‘Reason,’</span> spreading light, &amp;c. The
National Convention, and all the authorities,
attended at this burlesque and insulting ceremony.
In February, 1794, a grand fête was
ordered by the convention, in which hymns
to Liberty were chanted, and a pageant in
honor of the abolition of slavery in the colonies,
was displayed in the <span class="tei tei-q">‘Temple of Reason.’</span>
In June another festival was ordered—to
the Supreme Being: the God of Philosophy.
But the most superb exhibition was
the <span class="tei tei-q">‘general festival,’</span> in honor of the republic.
It was distinguished by a more audacious
spirit of scoffing and profanation than the
former. Robespierre acted the <span class="tei tei-q">‘high-priest of
Reason’</span> on the day, and made himself conspicuous
in blasphemy. He was then at
the summit of power,—actual sovereign of
France.”</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The dead bodies of the witnesses, would be
their existence in that prohibited condition,
when, in France, neither the Scriptures, nor
the church showed any symptoms of life. In
the street, would be the conspicuous and public
manner in which indignities should be
heaped on them. France had been one of the
principal states yielding homage to the Roman
church. Surrounding nations beheld, but
would not permit the extermination of the
Bible and Christianity.

The French made merry over their blasphemous
work. Says Dr. Croley:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“A very remarkable and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">prophetic</span></em> distinction
of this period, was the spirit of frenzied
festivity which seized upon France. The
capital, and all the republican towns, were
the scene of civic feasts, processions, and
shows of the most extravagant kind. The
most festive times of peace under the most
expensive kings were thrown into the shade
by the frequency, variety, and extent of the
republican exhibitions. Yet this was a time
of perpetual miseries throughout France. The
guillotine was bloody from morn till night.
In the single month of July, 1794, nearly <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">eight
hundred persons</span></em>, the majority, principal individuals
of the state, and all possessing some
respectability of situation, were guillotined in
Paris alone. In the midst of this horror, there
were twenty-six theatres open, filled with the
most profane and profligate displays in honor
of the <span class="tei tei-q">‘triumph of reason.’</span> ”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In Lyons a Bible was tied to the tail of an
ass and dragged in a procession through the
streets of that city. Thus they rejoiced over
the supposed end of religion in France; and
congratulated themselves that the terrors of
God's word, and the church would no more
torment them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“After three days and a half,”</span> would be
that number of years from the suppression of
Christianity in November, 1793. On the 17th
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page131">[pg 131]</span><a name="Pg131" id="Pg131" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
day of June, 1797, three and a half years from
the abolition of the Bible and religious worship,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Camille Jourdan</span></span>, in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Council of Five
Hundred</span></span>, brought up the memorable report
on the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Revision of the Laws Relative to Religious
Worship</span></span>, by which France gave permission
to all citizens to buy or hire edifices
for the free exercise of it; repealing all opposing
laws, and subjecting those to a heavy fine
who should in any way impede or interrupt
any religious service. The Bible and the
church again stood erect, to the dismay of
all who had rejoiced over their overthrow.
Those two witnesses were again in a position
to resume their testimony.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
They were not only to be thus restored, but
were to be elevated far above their former
position. Since that epoch, have been made
all those great efforts to evangelize the world,
by means of missionary, tract, Bible, and
other benevolent societies, which have caused
the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Scriptures</span></em> to be translated into nearly all
known languages, and carried by the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">living
preacher</span></em> to the ends of the earth. The very
room in which Voltaire uttered his famous
prediction—that <span class="tei tei-q">“the time would arrive
when the Bible would be regarded only in
the light of an old curiosity,”</span>—is now used
for a Bible depository, and is <span class="tei tei-q">“piled to the
ceiling with that rare old book.”</span> Copies of
the Bible have been multiplied a million fold,
and scattered broadcast over the earth. The
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page132">[pg 132]</span><a name="Pg132" id="Pg132" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
other witness,—the church, has since then,
also, been greatly magnified. In this age of
missions and Bibles, the number of believers
has been greatly multiplied; and missionaries
have penetrated all lands. The last half-century
has been distinguished for its wonderful
revivals; and the servants of the cross
have <span class="tei tei-q">“prophesied [or testified] again before
many peoples, and nations, and tongues, and
kings,”</span> 10:11.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The same hour, is the time of the slaughter
of the witnesses. Its epoch was to be marked
by a great political revolution, which, in the
Apocalypse, is symbolized by an earthquake.
In the year in which Christianity was suppressed
by France, they beheaded their king, abolished
the monarchy, and entirely revolutionized
the government. In the reign of terror following,
the best blood of the nation was shed
like water, and no man of influence could
consider his life secure. Men, women and
children were dragged before the revolutionary
tribunals, had their accusations read to
them, and were immediately condemned, and
hurried off in crowds without a trial, to be
shot, drowned or beheaded. At Lyons thirty-one
thousand persons were thus slain; at
Nantes thirty-two thousand,—and throughout
France in proportion. The number thus
slain, has been estimated at over one million,—a
number hardly credible, and which might
well be symbolized by seven thousand—a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page133">[pg 133]</span><a name="Pg133" id="Pg133" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
perfect number. Well might the remnant be
affrighted, and hasten to give glory to the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span></span>
of heaven, by the restoration of that book, the
setting aside of which had involved them in
such dire calamities.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The tenth of the city which fell, must be
the tenth of the Roman hierarchy, which is
symbolized by the city. With the suppression
of religion, the Catholic church was prohibited,
with all others. France was one of
the ten kingdoms, and the overthrow of the
church in France, would be the fall of one-tenth
of that city.

The epoch symbolized, as appears from the

The church is the same in all ages, comprising
only the true people of God; all of

Previous to the first advent, the Jewish
church occupied a high political position, above
that of the inferior officers of state, and was
in the enjoyment of imperial favor. Patriarchs
and prophets—the messengers of the
church—were stars in her crown of rejoicing,
1:20. From the utterance of the prediction

Abraham rejoiced and was made glad at its

The seventy weeks indicated to the Jews
the time of <span class="tei tei-q">“the Messiah, the Prince,”</span> Dan.
9:26-27. When these were near their termination,
to the pious and devout Simeon who
was <span class="tei tei-q">“waiting for the consolation of Israel,”</span>
it <span class="tei tei-q">“was revealed by the Holy Ghost, that he
should not see death before he had seen the
Lord's Christ,”</span> Luke 2:25, 26. And the
opinion was so general, that when the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Baptist</span></em>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page144">[pg 144]</span><a name="Pg144" id="Pg144" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

John, whether he were the Christ or no,”</span>
Luke 3:15. This expectation is testified to
by the Jewish historians Philo and Josephus;

The belief that some remarkable personage
was about to appear in Judea, was not confined

Rome, Greece, and wherever the Jews were
scattered abroad. Says Suetonius, a Roman
historian: <span class="tei tei-q">“An ancient and settled persuasion
prevailed throughout the East, that the
Fates had decreed some one to proceed from
Judea, who should attain universal empire.”</span>
And Tacitus, another Roman historian, says:

The great red dragon sustains a relation to
the woman, analogous to that sustained by
the nondescript beast (of Dan. 7:7), to the
saints of the Most High; and his position respecting
the man-child is like that of the exceeding
great horn (Dan. 8:9), to the Prince of
princes, Dan. 8:25. Like the beast referred
to, the dragon has ten horns; and its characteristics
indicate that it also symbolizes the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page145">[pg 145]</span><a name="Pg145" id="Pg145" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Roman empire,—<span class="tei tei-q">“the fourth kingdom upon
earth,”</span> Dan. 7:23. The dragon is a monster
serpent. <span class="tei tei-q">“That old serpent”</span> who seduced
Eve (Gen. 3:5), <span class="tei tei-q">“called the devil”</span> (Matt.
4:1-12), and <span class="tei tei-q">“Satan”</span> (2 Cor. 2:11),
<span class="tei tei-q">“who deceiveth the whole world,”</span> is an appropriate
representative of Rome.

The <span class="tei tei-q">“head”</span> of a beast, sustains a relation
to the beast analogous to that of the government
to the people of an empire. It is that
by which the beast is directed and governed.
When distinguished from the body of the
beast (Dan. 7:11), according to the analogy,
it must be understood as a symbol of the directing
and controlling power, in the kingdom
indicated by the beast. Several heads on the
same beast, on this principle, must indicate the
several forms of government to which the nation
is subject. As these cannot be contemporary,
like the divisions of a kingdom represented
by the horns, they must be successive.
To suppose they represent different governments,
destroys the analogy, and makes them
separate beasts, instead of heads of the same
beast; and no government can be subject to
more than one head at the same time.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <span class="tei tei-q">“seven heads”</span> of the dragon, then,
symbolize the directing and controlling powers
which ruled the Roman empire,—the seven
successive forms of government under which
it existed. Rome was founded about B. C.
753, from small beginnings, on the summit of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page146">[pg 146]</span><a name="Pg146" id="Pg146" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Mount Palatine, and gradually increased in
extent, till it spread over seven hills: the Palatine,
Capitoline, Aventine, Esquiline, Cœlius,
and Quirinalia; and its population of about
three thousand in the time of Romulus, increased
to about two millions in the time of
Augustus Cæsar.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Previous to the subversion of the empire,
Rome existed under different forms of government,
as follows:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Kingly.</span></span>—The first government established
was a monarchy, and lasted two hundred
and forty-four years, under seven kings,
viz., Romulus, Numa, Tullus Hostilius, Ancus
Martius, Tarquin Priscus, Servius Tullius,
and Tarquin the Proud, who was afterwards
expelled from the throne. This was denominated
the infancy of the Roman empire.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Consular.</span></span>—In B. C. 509, the constitution
of Rome was remodelled, and the executive
power committed to two consuls, to
be elected annually. This commenced the
<span class="tei tei-q">“Commonwealth of Rome.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dictatorial.</span></span>—The office of dictator was
the highest known in Rome, and was only resorted
to in cases of emergency. He was
elected for six months only, and usually resigned
his authority, which, for the time, was
nearly absolute, as soon as he had effected the
object for which he was chosen.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Decemviral.</span></span>—In B. C. 451, the government
was so changed, that, instead of the two
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page147">[pg 147]</span><a name="Pg147" id="Pg147" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
consuls, the government was committed to ten
men, to be chosen annually, and jointly exercise
the sovereign power. After two years the
decemvirs were banished, and the consular
government was restored.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
5. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Tribunitial.</span></span>—In B. C. 426, Rome having
become a military state, military tribunes
were substituted for the consular power, till
B. C. 366, when the latter was again restored.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
6. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pagan Imperial.</span></span>—With the battle of
Actium, B. C. 31, the Roman Commonwealth
terminated; and Augustus Cæsar united in
his own person not only the offices of Consul,
Tribune, &amp;c., but also that of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Supreme Pontiff</span></span>,—the
head of the pagan hierarchy. This
last office, says Gibbon, <span class="tei tei-q">“was constantly exercised
by the emperors.”</span> Thus were united
the highest civil and ecclesiastical powers of
the state.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
7. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Christian Imperial.</span></span>—In A. D. 312, the
government was revolutionized, by the accession
of Constantine to the throne. He effected
important changes in the relations of the people
to the monarch, opposed idolatry, and by
the introduction of Christianity, effected a
political change in the laws and administration
of the empire. This continued, with a slight
interruption under Julian the Apostate, till the
subversion of the Western empire, A. D. 476.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Mr. Elliott, in explanation of the first five
heads, says: <span class="tei tei-q">“I adopt, with the most entire
satisfaction, that generally-received Protestant
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page148">[pg 148]</span><a name="Pg148" id="Pg148" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
interpretation, which, following the authoritative
statement of Livy and Tacitus (the latter
great historian, St. John's own contemporary),
enumerates kings, consuls, dictators,
decemvirs, and military tribunes, as the first
five constitutional heads of the Roman city
and commonwealth; then as the sixth, the
Imperial head, commencing with Octavian.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Horæ
Apoca.</span></span>, vol. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">III.</span></span>, p. 106, 4th ed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Those heads are shown to symbolize seven
forms of government, by the explanation that
<span class="tei tei-q">“they are seven mountains where the woman
sits on them [mountains also symbolizing
governments], and are seven kings,”</span> 17:9,
10. And they are shown to be successive, by
the fact that, when John wrote, the first five
had passed away, one only then existed,—the
Pagan Imperial,—and the other head was
then in the future, 17:10.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <span class="tei tei-q">“ten horns”</span> also symbolize kings, or
dynasties; but, unlike the heads, instead of being
successive, they are contemporaneous. According
to the explanation, they had received
no kingdom when John wrote, and were all
to exercise power at the same time: <span class="tei tei-q">“The
ten horns which thou didst see, are ten kings
who have not yet received a kingdom; but
they receive power as kings, one hour with
the wild beast,”</span> 17:12. These will be more
particularly noticed in connection with the

The <span class="tei tei-q">“seven crowns”</span> on the heads of the
dragon, indicate that the acts here symbolized,
would be fulfilled during the period when
the sovereignty of Rome should be vested in the
forms of government symbolized by the heads,
and not during that symbolized by the horns.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The woman appeared in the symbolic
heavens anterior to the dragon. Prior to the
birth of Christ, the church was conspicuous
and honored. The sacrifices which smoked
on Jewish altars, were offered to Jehovah.
The subjects of the divine government conducted
their service with all the splendor imparted
by the Jewish ritual. Royalty was an
appendage of the nation: the sceptre did not
depart from Judah, nor a law-giver from between
his feet, till Shiloh came, Gen. 49:10.
By an alliance with the Romans, B. C. 135,
Rome took its position in the presence of the
woman.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The first act of the dragon was by a sweep
of its tail to draw down one-third of the stars,
and to cast them to the earth. This was before
the birth of the man-child. After Rome
attained the supremacy, Judea proportionably
suffered. Her glory was measurably dimmed
by many indignities before her subjugation
to Rome was consummated. Jerusalem was
repeatedly besieged. At one time (B. C.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page150">[pg 150]</span><a name="Pg150" id="Pg150" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
94) Alexander Jannæus slew six thousand
persons on account of their meeting in the
temple at the feast of tabernacles. In B. C.
63, Judea was conquered by Pompey, the Roman
general. In B. C. 54, Crassus plundered
the temple of Jerusalem. In B. C. 37, Jerusalem
was taken, after a siege of six months.
Various other difficulties occurred between
Judea and Rome, previous to the Saviour's
advent, on account of which she was greatly
depressed and humbled, so that it might with
propriety be said that one-third of her stars
were cast to the ground. This depression was
one great reason why the church within her
borders looked so earnestly for a Deliverer.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Man-child is the one <span class="tei tei-q">“who was to rule
all nations with a rod of iron,”</span> according
to the prediction of Christ in the second Psalm;
which proves its reference to the Saviour.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The purpose of the dragon to destroy the
child of the woman as soon as it should be
born, in accordance with the view here taken,
would symbolize the purpose of the Roman
power, by the agency of Herod the Roman
governor in Judea, to destroy the infant Saviour.
<span class="tei tei-q">“When he had gathered all the chief
priests and scribes of the people together, he
demanded of them where Christ should be
born. And they said unto him, In Bethlehem,
in Judea: for thus it is written by the prophet.”</span>
And Herod <span class="tei tei-q">“sent forth and slew all the
children that were in Bethlehem, and in all
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page151">[pg 151]</span><a name="Pg151" id="Pg151" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the coasts thereof, from two years old and
under, according to the time which he had
diligently inquired of the wise men,”</span> Matt. 2:1-16.
Thus Rome sought to slay the Saviour
as soon as he was born; but Joseph took
the child and fled into Egypt. Afterwards
Christ was crucified by Roman soldiers, and
deposited in the tomb, arising again the third
day.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
His being caught up to God and to his
throne, symbolizes his resurrection from the
dead, and ascension from the Mount of Olives
(Acts 1:9), to the right hand of the Majesty
on high; <span class="tei tei-q">“whom the heaven must receive
until the times of restitution of all things,”</span>
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ib.</span></span> 3:21.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The flight of the woman into the wilderness,
denotes her descent from the conspicuous
position she had occupied, and the dispersion
of the church. With the crucifixion of
Christ, Judaism was no longer the casket in
which the church was enshrined. It left its
place in the moral heavens, and the followers
of Christ were scattered abroad, Acts 8:1-4.
Thus she virtually fled into the wilderness—into
the condition, where, subsequently, she
was to be nourished for 1260 prophetic days.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is objected to the application of the man-child
to the Saviour, that it should be prophetic,
and not retrospective. This objection
would be equally valid to the application of
the symbolic heads, against which it is never
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page152">[pg 152]</span><a name="Pg152" id="Pg152" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
urged. That which is retrospective, to be
appropriately symbolized, must be in harmony
with, and explanatory of other parts. Thus,
by the man-child and previous travail of the
woman, she is identified, and her relation to
the dragon established. No other subject
could fulfil the conditions of the symbol, for
of no other was it predicted: <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou art my
Son; this day have I begotten thee.—Ask of
me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine
inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the
earth for thy possession.—Thou shalt break
them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them
in pieces like a potter's vessel,”</span> Psa. 2:8-10.

Michael and his angels, then, must symbolize
the body of Christ,—the apostles, and
their successor, under the guidance of the
Lord,—who constituted an army of religious
teachers. With the arrows of truth they assailed
the idolatrous combinations of their opponents.
Under the first seal, they are represented
by a mounted warrior, with bow and
crown, going forth conquering and to conquer,
6:2. See p. 58.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The dragon, with the appendages of heads,
horns, and diadems, was seen to be a symbol
of the Roman government. Divested of those,
it would simply represent the Pagan hierarchy
with which the contest was waged. The
heathen priests and their adherents, thus
warred with the preachers of Christianity.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Its prevailing not, shows the relative success
of the two parties. The struggle continued
from the day of Pentecost till the accession
of Constantine. The church waded
through bloody scenes of bitter persecution,
which, instead of diminishing, greatly added
to her numbers—<span class="tei tei-q">“the blood of the martyrs”</span>
proving <span class="tei tei-q">“the seed of the church.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The heathen priests were not deficient in
logic, philosophy, and artful sophistry, by
which to defend their mythology. They exhausted
these, and then resorted to persecution,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page154">[pg 154]</span><a name="Pg154" id="Pg154" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
torture, and death; yet they prevailed not.
With the weapons of truth, the teachers of
Christianity successfully assailed those antiquated
forms of error,—overcoming <span class="tei tei-q">“by the
blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their
testimony.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“They loved not their lives
unto the death,”</span> but freely gave themselves
for Christ, till, in time, the current of popular
favor ceased to flow in the direction of paganism.
The accession of Constantine to the
throne, put an end to the dragonic period of
Rome; the Pagan service gave place to the
worship of Jehovah. The rites of heathenism
were no longer the religion of the state, and
its ministers were displaced from the exalted
position they had so long occupied. Their
place was no longer in the symbolic heavens,
but in a less conspicuous station.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The casting out of the dragon, would then
be this expulsion of the pagan hierarchy from
its national importance, and the dejection of
the priesthood and their adherents to the
earth,—below their former high station,—and
to the sea, among the unsettled tribes
and nations outside of Rome. This being a
religious and not a political event, it does not
immediately affect Rome's nationality. That
it is not the overthrow of a kingdom, but of
religious rites, is shown by the rejoicings
which followed.

The loud voice is heard in the symbolic
heaven from which the Dragon had been
cast. By the displacement of the Pagan hierarchy,
and the substitution of Christianity
under Constantine, the adherents of the latter
succeeded to the place of the former, and rejoiced
over them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A loud voice symbolizes the utterance of the
thoughts and feelings of an interested multitude.
The nature of the voice indicates the
nature of the utterance—whether it be one
of expectation, fear, warning, or instruction.
This voice is expressive of the then prevalent
expectation, that, with the displacement of
Paganism commenced the establishment of the
Kingdom of God on earth. This belief was
not necessarily well founded;—its <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">existence</span></em>
only being symbolized.

On the triumph of Constantine over Licinius,
Eusebius says:—<span class="tei tei-q">“There were illuminations
everywhere. They who were before
dejected looked on one another with joyful aspects
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page156">[pg 156]</span><a name="Pg156" id="Pg156" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and smiles, and with choirs and hymns
through the cities and country, gave honor first
to God, the Supreme Ruler of all, as they were
taught, and then to the pious emperor and
his children.”</span> Says Mr Lord:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Eusebius represents the victors at the precipitation
of Maxentius and his attendants into
the Tiber, as saying, like Moses at the overthrow
of the Egyptians in the Red Sea: <span class="tei tei-q">‘Let

Horse and rider he has thrown into the sea.
The Lord my helper and defender was with
me unto salvation. Who, O Lord, is like
to thee among gods? Who is like to thee,
glorified by the holy, admirable in praise, doing
wonders? Constantine entered Rome in
triumph, hymning these and similar passages
to God, the author of the victory.’</span> And on
the fall of Licinius he represents the church
as uniting in thanksgiving for the deliverance,
and congratulations at the overthrow of idolatry,
and establishment of Christ's kingdom;
and devotes the tenth book of his history to
the edicts of the emperor by which the church
was nationalized and endowed, and to the
restoration of the temples, and the public
rejoicings at their dedication. <span class="tei tei-q">‘Let thanks be

to the inspired command to sing a new song,
inasmuch as after such direful spectacles and
narrations we now have the happiness to see
and celebrate what many holy men before us
and the martyrs for God desired to see on
earth, and did not see, and to hear, and have
not heard. But advancing more rapidly they
attained far superior gifts in heaven, being
caught up to the paradise of celestial joy;
while we acknowledge the gifts we enjoy are
greater than we deserve, and contemplate
with wonder the largeness of the divine bounty.
Admiring and adoring with all our souls,
we testify to the truth of the prophet's words,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Come and see the works of the Lord, what
wonders he has wrought in the earth, abolishing

Multitudes actually supposed the long-predicted
kingdom of God was now being
established. Says Mr. Elliott:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Can we wonder, then, at the exultation
that was felt at this time by many, perhaps by
most, that bore the Christian name: or at
their high-raised expectations as to the future
happy destiny of the Roman, now that it had
been changed into the Christian, nation? It
seemed to them as if it had become God's
covenanted people, like Israel of old: and the
expectation was not unnatural,—an expectation
strengthened by the remarkable tranquillity
which, throughout the extent of the
now reünited empire, followed almost immediately
on Constantine's establishment of
Christianity,—that not only the temporal
blessings of the ancient Jewish covenant would
thenceforth in no small measure attach to
them, but even those prophesied of as appertaining
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page159">[pg 159]</span><a name="Pg159" id="Pg159" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to the latter day. Hence on the medals
of that era the emblem of the phœnix, all
radiant with the rising sunbeams, to represent
the empire as now risen into new life and
hope, and its legend which spoke of the happy
restoration of the times. Hence, in forgetfulness
of all former prognostications of Antichrist
and fearful coming evils, the reference
by some of the most eminent of their bishops
to the latter-day blessedness, as even then
about fulfilling. The state of things was such,
Eusebius tells us, that it looked like <span class="tei tei-q">‘the very
image of the kingdom of Christ.’</span> The city
built by the emperor at Jerusalem, beside the
new and magnificent Church of the Holy
Sepulchre,—the sacred capital, as it were, to
the new empire,—might be, perhaps, he suggested,
the New Jerusalem, the theme of so
many prophecies. Yet again, on occasion of
the opening of the new church at Tyre, he
expressed in the following glowing language,
not his own feelings only, but those, we may
be sure, of not a few of the congregated
Christian ministers and people that heard
him: <span class="tei tei-q">‘What so many of the Lord's saints
and confessors before our time desired to see,
and saw not, and to hear, and heard not, that
behold now before our eyes! It was of us
the prophet spake when he told how the wildernesses
and solitary places should be glad,
and the desert rejoice and blossom as the lily.
Whereas the church was widowed and desolate,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page160">[pg 160]</span><a name="Pg160" id="Pg160" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
her children have now to exclaim to her,
Make room, enlarge thy borders! the place is
too strait for us. The promise is fulfilling to
her, In righteousness shalt thou be established:
all thy children shall be taught of
God: and great shall be the peace of thy children.’</span> ”</span>—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Horæ
Apoc.</span></span>, v. i., pp. 230-1.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
They rejoiced over the downfall of the dragon
as over <span class="tei tei-q">“the Accuser of our brethren, who
accused them before our God day and night.”</span>
The phrase <span class="tei tei-q">“our brethren,”</span> proves that those
who unite in this song are the living saints
on the earth. The reference to Satan as an
Accuser bears a close resemblance to Zech.
3:1, where Joshua, as a symbol of the people
of Israel, is represented as standing before the
angel of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span></span>, and Satan standing at his
right hand to resist him.—<span class="tei tei-q">“שטן Satan signifies
an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">adversary</span></em>. רשטנו <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">lesiteno</span></span>, to be his
adversary or accuser.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dr. Clark.</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Satan's most common work is to invent
false accusations against those whose efforts
tend to frustrate his designs. The Christians
had endured false accusations and bitter persecutions,
and therefore rejoiced the more
over the defeat of the Pagans.

The rejoicing of Christians, according to
this symbolization, is afterwards followed by
renewed triumphs of the Pagans over them.
The hatred of the Pagan worshippers to
Christianity, is strikingly evinced; but it is
manifested in a manner different from the former
contest.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When the church sought only to overcome
by <span class="tei tei-q">“the blood of the Lamb, and by the word
of their testimony,”</span> it was owned of Christ;
but as it became proud and worldly, and
cared more for popular favor than for purity of
faith and practice, the true church which the
woman symbolized, was represented only by
those who continued faithful to their profession.
Historians inform us that with the success
of Constantine, the visible church became
speedily corrupt. As it became popular, unconverted
men sought to be enrolled as members.
The Pagans, instead of approaching as
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page162">[pg 162]</span><a name="Pg162" id="Pg162" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
enemies, came as professed friends. As a
profession of Christianity was alone necessary
for admission to the church, multitudes
sought connection with it. This caused a
condition of things, of which Dr. Milner thus
speaks:—<span class="tei tei-q">“In the general appearance of the
church, we cannot see much of the spirit of
godliness. External piety flourished. But
faith, love, heavenly-mindedness appear very
rare. The doctrine of real conversion was
very much lost, and external baptism placed
in its stead: and the true doctrine of justification
by faith, and true practical use of a crucified
Saviour for troubled consciences were
scarcely to be seen at this time. Superstition
and self-righteousness were making vigorous
shoots; and the real gospel of Christ was hidden
from the men that professed it.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To the same effect is the report of Mosheim:—Of
the life and morals of the professing
Christians of the fourth century, he says:
<span class="tei tei-q">“Good men were, as before, mixed with bad;
but the bad were by degrees so multiplied,
that men truly holy and devoted to God appeared
more rarely; and the pious few were
almost oppressed by the vicious multitude.”</span>
Of their doctrines he says: <span class="tei tei-q">“Fictions, of early
origin”</span> (about saint veneration and relics,
a purifying fire, celibacy, &amp;c., &amp;c.), <span class="tei tei-q">“now
so prevailed as in course of time almost to
thrust true religion aside, or at least to exceedingly
obscure and tarnish it.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Says Mr Lord:—<span class="tei tei-q">“Constantine and his
successors introduced a flood of false doctrines,
superstitions and idolatries, into the church,
which were incompatible with a pure worship,
and swept all who yielded to their impulse
to the gulf of apostasy. Such were the
veneration of the cross, and ascription to it of
miraculous powers, the homage of relics, the
invocation of saints, the conversion of religion
into gorgeous ceremonies, the encouragement
of celibacy, and the arrogation of the throne
and prerogatives of God by civil and ecclesiastical
rulers. These falsehoods, follies, and impieties,
introduced or adopted by the emperors,
encouraged by their example, sanctioned
by their laws, and enforced by the penalties
of excommunication, imprisonment, the forfeiture
of civil rights, banishment, and death,
came armed with an overpowering force to
all who were not fortified against them by the
special aids of the divine spirit, and like a resistless
torrent bore away the great mass of
the church.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Exp. of Apoc.</span></span>, p. 350.

With the accession of multitudes of unworthy
members, and the prevalence of false doctrines,
the true church would have been speedily
overwhelmed had not the people of God
been sustained from such deleterious influences.
To the woman, therefore, were given
two wings of a great eagle that she might escape.
Wings are symbolic of power of flight—for
succor, or escape. The four-winged

and demolish the enemy; the woman, to escape
hers. The church of old was sustained
in like manner. Thus God said to Israel,

On the introduction of new rites and doctrines
into the church, multitudes withdrew
from the public assemblies, and worshipped
apart. They retired from the observation of
their rulers and lived secluded for a long period.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Some may inquire for the historical evidence
of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">time</span></em> when such a body withdrew.
This, from the nature of the case, it may be
difficult to give. If the withdrawal of the
true worshippers had been an occurrence of
so much notoriety as to be prominently historically
noticed, it might have defeated their
withdrawal. It is sufficient that the prophecy
makes such a withdrawal necessary; and
that at a later period such a body was found
existing as predicted. See p. <a href="#Pg198" class="tei tei-ref">198</a>. Says Mr.

that they continued, after her disappearance,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page165">[pg 165]</span><a name="Pg165" id="Pg165" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

The only evidence that we can ask or possess,
that they were conferred, is presented in the
fact that a body of dissentients from the corrupt

secluded scene, who had survived the endeavors

The flood of water cast out after the woman,

The sea, from which this beast emerged,

Its characteristics resemble those of the
lion, bear, and leopard, of Daniel's vision

the Babylonian, Medo-Persian, and Grecian

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page171">[pg 171]</span><a name="Pg171" id="Pg171" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
nondescript beast, (Dan. 7:7); which

the same ten-fold partition of the
Roman empire.

His power, seat, and great authority being
given by the dragon, is another evidence that
it is a continuation of that fourth kingdom
succeeding to its sovereignty. The laws of
the ancient empire were generally adopted by
the ten kingdoms, which assumed and exercised
the prerogatives of ancient Rome. Says
Bossuet: <span class="tei tei-q">“Whoever carefully examines the
laws of the Theodosian and Justinian codes
against heretics, will see that they are the
source of the decrees against them, that
the church, aided by the edicts of princes,
enacted in the third and fourth Lateran councils.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The head, which was as it were wounded
to death, would indicate that under the government
symbolized by that head, the life of the
beast had become apparently extinct. This
was the case when the empire was subverted.
In the succession of the previous forms of
government, the empire itself was not in any
particular peril. They gave place, each to its
successor, without any subversion of the government.
But when the seventh head ceased
to exercise sovereignty, the beast itself was
apparently dead. The wound, however, did
not prove mortal. The beast still lived. Its
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page172">[pg 172]</span><a name="Pg172" id="Pg172" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
sovereignty was perpetuated by the decemregal
governments; which constituted the
eighth form of government—symbolized by
the beast that was, is not, and yet is again in
existence and will continue till the day of perdition,
17:11; 19:20.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
They worshipped the dragon and beast, by
regarding the latter as a continuation of the
former power, and regarding the sovereign
power of Rome as unparalleled and invincible—as
is shown by the questions: <span class="tei tei-q">“Who is like
unto the beast? Who is able to make war
with him?”</span> Those combined governments
were regarded by their subjects with wonder
and veneration. Says Mr. Lord: <span class="tei tei-q">“The
serfs and common people, sunk for ages to the
most degraded vassalage, revered the monarchs,
the various ranks of nobles, and their
armed followers, as a superior race, while poets

their usurpations, and eulogized the wisdom
and benignity of their rule.”</span>

The mouth of the beast, must symbolize the
agency by which utterance is given to the
great things and blasphemies which are
spoken by it. Its likeness to the mouth of
the lion, shows its resemblance to the Babylonian
worship of the dead. Moses was <span class="tei tei-q">“not
eloquent,”</span>—he was <span class="tei tei-q">“slow of speech and of a
slow tongue,”</span> and the Lord said to him,
Aaron <span class="tei tei-q">“shall be thy spokesman unto the
people: and he shall be, even he shall be to
thee instead of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a mouth</span></em>,”</span> Ex. 4:10, 16. As
Aaron was a mouth to Moses, so did the
Papacy become a mouth-piece for the Roman
kingdoms. It was the agency by which the
people were taught; and through which utterance
was given to the blasphemies of the
beast. It fills a place analogous to that of the
image afterwards symbolized, which also had
like power to speak blasphemies. See p. <a href="#Pg188" class="tei tei-ref">188</a>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The beast had power to continue to utter
blasphemies by the mouth given to it, forty-two

with that of the <span class="tei tei-q">“little horn”</span> (Dan. 7:25),
of which it was said, <span class="tei tei-q">“He shall speak

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. This mouth uttered blasphemy against
God by claiming to be Christ's vicegerent—usurping
the prerogatives of the Almighty.
The Pope claimed that he was <span class="tei tei-q">“Judge, as
God's Vicar, and could himself be judged by
none.”</span> In A. D. 799, a Roman council
declined to hear accusations against the Pope,
declaring that <span class="tei tei-q">“he who was Judge of all men,
was above being judged by any other than
himself.”</span> Febroni wrote of the Pope: <span class="tei tei-q">“He
is the Prince of princes and Lord of lords.
He is, as it were, a God on earth. He is
above right, superior to law, superior to the
canons. He can do all things against right,
and without right. He is able to free from
obligation in matters of positive right, without
any cause, and they who are so released are
safe in respect to God.”</span> Assuming such prerogatives,
and the power to forgive sins, the
Holy name of God was blasphemed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. He blasphemed the tabernacle of God
by <span class="tei tei-q">“exalting himself above all that is called
God, or that is worshipped; so that he as
God sitteth in the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">temple</span></em> of God, showing
himself that he is God,”</span> 2 Thess. 2:2. The
Pope claimed to be the head of the church and
that from himself was derived the authority
of all bishops and other clergy. He usurped
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page175">[pg 175]</span><a name="Pg175" id="Pg175" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the powers in the church, which only Christ,
its Supreme Head and Lawgiver can exercise.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. Those in heaven were blasphemed, by
the ascription to them of the attributes and
prerogatives of God; and by representing
them as being well pleased with the bestowal
on them of divine honors. Saint-worship by
the Papists and demon-worship by the Pagans
are alike. They both ascribe the same attributes
to the spirits of the departed,—all the
gods of the heathen being the ghosts of their
departed heroes. A revival of this blasphemy,
is subsequently symbolized by the frog-like
spirits which emerge from the mouths of the
beast, the dragon, and false prophet, 16:13,—see
p. <a href="#Pg255" class="tei tei-ref">255</a>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In connection with and in obedience to this
mouth, the beast warred with the saints, and
overcame them. Dissenters from the Papacy
were subjected to unheard of cruelties and
persecutions. And they whose names were
not written in the book of life, sustained their
rulers in these oppressive acts. In paying
more deference to the edicts of government
than to the requirements of Jehovah, they blasphemously
bestowed on the beast an homage
which was due only to God.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The revelator being shown what was to be
endured by the saints during a long period of
oppression, now receives an annunciation to
which all were to listen,—all who had ears to
hear. It was the announcement, that <span class="tei tei-q">“if any
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page176">[pg 176]</span><a name="Pg176" id="Pg176" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
one leadeth into captivity, he will go into captivity:
if any one killeth with the sword, he
must be killed with the sword.”</span> Most commentators
have considered this as applicable
to the fate of the wild beast,—that its end
was to be effected by the sword and captivity,
as it had in the same way tyrannized over the
saints. Mr. Lord offers some reasons for supposing
that it was a caution to the saints not
to resist with the sword the attacks of enemies,
nor to retaliate by making captives of the subjects
of the beast who should fall into their
power. He says:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The prediction that he who led into captivity
should himself become a captive, and he
that slew with the sword be himself slain, had
a signal fulfilment in the slaughter and vassalage
of all those who attempted to deliver
themselves by force from the religious tyranny
of the European monarchs.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The Albigenses were nearly exterminated
by the cruel armies against which they attempted
to defend themselves, and the small
number that remained after the devastation of
their fields, the conflagration of their cities,
and the promiscuous slaughters to which they
were subjected, were either forced to conform
to the Catholic church, or driven into other
lands. The Waldenses perished in far greater
numbers by the sword, in their struggles for
preservation and freedom, than by the fires of
martyrdom; and sunk, after their contests, to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page177">[pg 177]</span><a name="Pg177" id="Pg177" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
a still more hopeless vassalage to their persecutors.
The resort to the sword by the
Bohemians and the Huguenots of France, to
defend their religious freedom, resulted, after
vast slaughters, in their defeat and helpless
subjection to the tyranny from which they
endeavored to extricate themselves. And the
Protestants of Switzerland, Germany, Holland,
Denmark, Sweden, and Great Britain,
who succeeded in delivering themselves from
the dominion of their ancient tyrants, instead
of securing thereby their religious liberty, only
placed themselves, by the nationalization of

All the forms of Roman government symbolized

by the two-horned beast must have
been subsequent to the commencement of the
Roman empire. And as it caused those who
dwell on the earth to worship that beast after
its deadly wound was healed, it must have
arisen anterior to the healing of that wound;
and, consequently, before the succession of
the ten kingdoms to the sovereignty of Rome,
with which it held an intimate relation.

the Eastern Roman empire; which, consequently,
is the government represented by the
two-horned beast.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The imperial heads of Rome date from the
battle of Actium, B. C. 31; but the Eastern
empire was not commenced, till A. D. 324,
when Constantine removed the seat of empire
from Rome to Constantinople. Rome was,
previous to that removal, the undisputed
queen of nations, and Constantine was without
a rival. Why he should abandon Rome,
the citadel and throne of the Cæsars, for an
obscure corner of Thrace, has never been satisfactorily
explained. Says Dr. Croly: <span class="tei tei-q">“The
change of government to Constantinople still
perplexes the historian. It was an act in
direct repugnance to the whole course of the
ancient prejudices.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The indifference with which Constantine
viewed the country of the Cæsars, was regarded
by Gibbon as the cause of removal.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He transferred the customs and forms of
the Roman government, and there exercised
all the powers of the empire,—the Italians
still obeying the edicts which he condescended
to address from Constantinople to the Senate
and people of Rome. The western division
continued dependent on the eastern head, till
the death of Theodosius, A. D. 395. His two
sons, Arcadius and Honorius, <span class="tei tei-q">“were saluted
by the unanimous consent of mankind, as the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page181">[pg 181]</span><a name="Pg181" id="Pg181" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
lawful emperors of the East, and of the
West,”</span>—the European boundary being <span class="tei tei-q">“not
very different from that which separates the
Germans from the Turks.”</span>—Gibbon, v. 2, p.
199. Gibbon calls this <span class="tei tei-q">“the final and permanent
division of the Roman empire.”</span> But its
existence as a beast more properly dates from
the removal of Constantine.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Its two horns like a lamb, must symbolize
two divisions of the kingdom. These may be
contemporary, like those symbolized by the
ten horns (17:12), or successive, like the two
horns of the ram, Dan. 8:3, 20. From the
history of the Eastern empire, the latter is
the more probable; and its historical resemblance
to the government symbolized by the
ram, may be the reason of the comparison to
<span class="tei tei-q">“horns like a lamb.”</span> As Persia was a government
outside of Media, and succeeded to
its sovereignty, so did the kingdom of the
Turks originate outside of the Eastern empire,
and at length come in, occupy its territory,
and succeed to its sovereignty, A. D.
1253. With this view, the horns would symbolize
the kings of Eastern Rome and of
Turkey. See pp. <a href="#Pg099" class="tei tei-ref">99-104</a>.

Its dragon-like speech shows it to be a
blasphemous, persecuting power, like that
which persecuted the woman, 12:17. Though
the Greek empire claimed to be Christian, a
successor of Constantine, Julian the Apostate,
renounced Christianity, endeavored to restore
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page182">[pg 182]</span><a name="Pg182" id="Pg182" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the Pagan service in Constantinople, and <span class="tei tei-q">“declared
himself the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">implacable enemy of Christ</span></em>.”</span>
He assumed the character of Supreme Pontiff,
and thus placed himself at the head of the
Pagan worship. He labored incessantly to
restore and propagate those dragonic rites, and
even thought to disprove the predictions of
Christ by rebuilding the temple of Jerusalem.
<span class="tei tei-q">“He affected to pity the unhappy Christians, as
mistaken in the most important object of their
lives; but his pity was degraded by contempt,
his contempt was embittered by hatred;
and the sentiments of Julian were expressed
in a style of sarcastic wit which
inflicts a deep and deadly wound whenever it
issues from the mouth of a sovereign.”</span> And
he intimated that they might have occasion
<span class="tei tei-q">“to dread, not only confiscation and exile, but
fire and the sword.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Gibbon.</span></span>

The successors of Julian, though Christian
in name, issued cruel and tyrannical edicts.
Valens embraced Arianism, and bitterly persecuted
the Orthodox party. Justinian established
Catholicism by arms. Theodosius
proscribed Paganism by the infliction
of severe penalties. Marcian and Leo <span class="tei tei-q">“enforced,
with arms and edicts, the symbols of
their faith,”</span> and it was declared that <span class="tei tei-q">“the

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page183">[pg 183]</span><a name="Pg183" id="Pg183" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
religious intolerance towards dissenting
creeds was still more rigidly enforced.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Eastern empire exercised all the power
of the Western. The original organization
of its government was the same, and it had
the same titles and prerogatives. Gibbon
says of Julian: <span class="tei tei-q">“The spirit of his administration,
and his regard for the place of his nativity,
induced him to confer on the senate of
Constantinople the same honors, privileges,

It caused worship to be bestowed on the
first beast, by extending to the Latin rulers
that aid which enabled them to perpetuate
their system of tyranny, to legislate over the

Among the wonders it would perform,
making fire come down from heaven is specified.
John does not intimate that he saw, in
vision, fire thus descend. The fact is spoken
of; and therefore it is not necessarily symbolic,
but may refer to literal fire. Gibbon,
in speaking of <span class="tei tei-q">“the novelty, the terrors, and
the real efficacy of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Greek fire</span></span>,”</span> for which
the Eastern empire was so famous, says:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The important secret of compounding and
directing this artificial flame was imparted by
Callinicus, a native of Heliopolis, in Syria,
who deserted from the service of the caliph to
that of the emperor. The skill of a chemist
and engineer was equivalent to the succor of
fleets and armies; and this discovery or improvement
of the military art was fortunately
reserved for the distressful period, when the
degenerate Romans of the East were incapable
of contending with the warlike enthusiasm
and youthful vigor of the Saracens. The historian
who presumes to analyze this extraordinary
composition, should suspect his own
ignorance and that of his Byzantine guides, so
prone to the marvellous, so careless, and, in
this instance, so jealous of the truth. From
their obscure, and perhaps fallacious hints, it
should seem that the principal ingredient of
the Greek fire was the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">naphtha</span></span>, or liquid bitumen,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page185">[pg 185]</span><a name="Pg185" id="Pg185" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
a light, tenacious, and inflammable oil,
which springs from the earth, and catches
fire as soon as it comes in contact with the
air. The naphtha was mingled, I know not by
what methods, or in what proportions, with
sulphur, and with the pitch that is extracted
from evergreen firs. From this mixture,
which produced a thick smoke and a loud explosion,
proceeded a fierce and obstinate flame,
which not only rose in perpendicular ascent,
but likewise burned with equal vehemence in
descent or lateral progress; instead of being
extinguished, it was nourished and quickened
by the element of water; and sand, urine, or
vinegar, were the only remedies that could
damp the fury of this powerful agent, which
was justly denominated by the Greeks, the
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">liquid</span></em>, or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">maritime</span></em> fire. For the annoyance
of the enemy, it was employed with equal
effect by sea and land, in battles or in sieges.
It was either poured from the rampart in
large boilers, or launched in red-hot balls of
stone and iron, or darted in arrows and javelins,
twisted round with flax and tow, which
had deeply imbibed the inflammable oil;
sometimes it was deposited in fire-ships, the
victims and instruments of a more ample revenge,
and was most commonly blown through
long tubes of copper, which were planted on
the prow of a galley, and fancifully shaped
into the mouths of savage monsters, that
seemed to vomit a stream of liquid and consuming
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page186">[pg 186]</span><a name="Pg186" id="Pg186" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
fire. This important art was preserved
at Constantinople, as the palladium of
the state; the galleys and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">artillery</span></em> might occasionally
be lent to the allies of Rome; but
the composition on the Greek fire was concealed
with the most jealous scruple, and the
terror of the enemies was increased and prolonged
by their ignorance and surprise. In
the treatise of the administration of the empire,
the royal author suggests the answers and excuses
that might best elude the indiscreet curiosity
and importunate demands of the barbarians.
They should be told that the mystery
of the Greek fire had been revealed by an
angel to the first and greatest of the Constantines,
with a sacred injunction, that this gift
of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">heaven</span></em>, this peculiar blessing of the Romans
should never be communicated to any
foreign nation; that the prince and subject
were alike bound to religious silence
under the temporal and spiritual penalties of
treason and sacrilege; and that the impious
attempt would provoke the sudden and supernatural
vengeance of the God of the Christians.
By these precautions the secret was
confined, above four hundred years, to the
Romans of the East; and at the end of the
eleventh century, the Pisans, to whom every
sea and every art were familiar, suffered the
effects, without understanding the composition,
of the Greek fire. It was at length
either discovered or stolen by the Mohammedans;
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page187">[pg 187]</span><a name="Pg187" id="Pg187" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and, in the holy wars of Syria and
Egypt, they retorted an invention, contrived
against themselves, on the heads of the Christians.
A knight, who despised the swords
and lances of the Saracens, relates, with
heartfelt sincerity, his own fears and those of
his companions, at the sight and sound of the
mischievous engine that discharged a torrent
of the Greek fire, the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">feu Gregeois</span></span>, as it is
styled by the more early of the French writers.
It came flying through the air, says
Joinville, like a winged long-tailed dragon,
about the thickness of a hogshead, with the report
of thunder, and the velocity of lightning;
and the darkness of night was <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dispelled by this

<span class="tei tei-q">“The Greeks would gladly have ransomed
their religion and empire, by a fine or assessment
of a piece of gold on the head of each
inhabitant of the city; but the liberal offer
was rejected with disdain, and the presumption
of Moslemah was exalted by the speedy
approach and invincible force of the natives
of Egypt and Syria. They are said to have
amounted to eighteen hundred ships: the
number betrays their inconsiderable size; and
of the twenty stout and capacious vessels,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page188">[pg 188]</span><a name="Pg188" id="Pg188" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
whose magnitude impeded their progress,
each was manned with no more than one
hundred heavy-armed soldiers. This huge
armada proceeded on a smooth sea and with
a gentle gale, towards the mouth of the Bosphorus;
the surface of the strait was over-shadowed,
in the language of the Greeks,
with a moving forest, and the same fatal
night had been fixed by the Saracen chief for
a general assault by sea and land. To allure
the confidence of the enemy, the emperor had
thrown aside the chain that usually guarded
the entrance of the harbor: but while they
hesitated whether they should seize the opportunity
or apprehend the snare, the ministers
of destruction were at hand. The fireships
of the Greeks were launched against them:
the Arabs, their arms and vessels, were involved

overwhelmed in the waves; and I no longer

This new creation is not another beast, but
the image of one. An image is only the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">likeness</span></em>
of something. As the beast symbolizes a political
power, its image must symbolize some
analogous power of a different nature; and
this likeness can only be found in a religious
government.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. The beast which received its death-wound
(v. 14), was the form of government
to which the image was made, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, the imperial.
Of this the Roman hierarchy was a
perfect counterpart. It was an ecclesiastical
government, coëxtensive in its authority with
the political power of the empire. And, like
the officers of the civil, there was a regular
gradation of rank in the subordinates of the
religious government. The head of the former
was an emperor, chosen by an electoral college,—the
senators of Rome.<a id="noteref_3" name="noteref_3" href="#note_3"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3</span></span></a> The head of
the latter was a Pope, chosen in a similar
manner by the college of Cardinals,—the
ecclesiastical senators of the religious empire.
Each of those bodies constituted the highest
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page190">[pg 190]</span><a name="Pg190" id="Pg190" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
deliberative and legislative body in its respective
government. The empire had its governors
of provinces, appointed by the imperial
head; and the spiritual rule of the church
was, in like manner, sustained by diocesan
bishops who, in their respective provinces,
were governors in spiritual matters and creatures
of the Pope. Subordinate offices in the
state and church, also, singularly corresponded.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. The religious customs of the empire, as
well as its political, were likewise imitated by
the papacy. Rome deified her heroes; the
papacy canonized her saints. The ghosts of
the departed were the gods of the heathen;
and the papists supplicate the dead. The
Pagans burned incense to their gods; the Papists
burn incense in their religious ceremonies.
The ancient heathen sprinkled themselves
with <span class="tei tei-q">“holy water;”</span> the Papists use
the same material in a similar manner. Lactantius
says of the Pagans, they <span class="tei tei-q">“light up
candles to God as if he lived in the dark;
and do they not deserve to pass for madmen
who offer lamps to the author and giver of
light?”</span> This custom is imitated by the Papists
in the use of wax candles on their altars.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The ancient Romans prostrated themselves
before images of wood and stone; and Jerome
tells us that <span class="tei tei-q">“by idols were to be understood
the images of the dead.”</span> In Catholic
Rome, worshippers prostrated themselves before
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page191">[pg 191]</span><a name="Pg191" id="Pg191" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
images of departed saints. The old Roman
Pantheon, which was dedicated by
Agrippa <span class="tei tei-q">“to Jove, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">and all the gods</span></em>,”</span> was re-consecrated
by Pope Boniface IV., about A. D.
610, <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to the blessed Virgin and all the
saints</span></em>.”</span> As in the old pagan temple, any
stranger could find the god of his own country;
so in its re-consecrated state, each country
could find its patron saint. Other temples
were changed and re-consecrated in the
same manner. The ancient statue of Jupiter
stands now as the statue of St. Peter. The
pagans had their vestal virgins; the Papists
their nuns.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“After a struggle of more than four centuries,
the ecclesiastics of all the hierarchies in
the empire were united in one vast organization,
with the pontiff as their supreme legislative
and judicial head, and a single ecclesiastical
government was established over the
whole Roman church, after the model of the
civil government of the ancient empire under
Constantine and his successors. It is, accordingly,
denominated by Catholics themselves
a monarchy. <span class="tei tei-q">‘All Catholic doctors agree
in this, that the ecclesiastical government
committed to men by God is a monarchy.’</span>—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bellarmini

<span class="tei tei-q">‘If the monarchical is the best form
of government, as we have shown, and it is
certain that the church of God instituted by

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The pontiffs were as absolutely the legislative
and judicial head of this ecclesiastical
kingdom, as the emperors from Constantine to
Augustulus were of the civil empire, and imposed
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page193">[pg 193]</span><a name="Pg193" id="Pg193" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
whatever laws they pleased on subordinate
ecclesiastics and on the church by decrees,
in the same manner as those emperors
enacted laws by edicts. The decrees, bulls of
canonization, sentences, charters, and other
legislative and judicial acts of the pontiffs,
from Gregory VII., in 1073, to Benedict XIV.,
in 1757, collected in the Bullarium Magnum,
fill nineteen folios. Many others are contained
in the decretals and councils.</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“They appointed to all ecclesiastical offices

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“They exacted oaths of fidelity from all

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“They established courts in which all violations
of their laws were tried, and a tribunal
at the capital for the decision of appeals.
There were gradations of rank in the hierarchy,
like those of the magistrates of the civil empire.
The hierarchies, as nationalized by
Constantine, were formed in each patriarchate,
after the model of the civil government in the
provinces. The hierarchy of the western
kingdoms, under the Pope, was formed after
that pattern; having archbishops or metropolitans
at the head of the clergy of each nation,
or large district, and bishops, abbots, and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page194">[pg 194]</span><a name="Pg194" id="Pg194" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
a long catalogue of subordinate ranks, under
each metropolitan.</span>

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These, with many other striking resemblances,
demonstrate that the Roman hierarchy,
in all its great features, was a counterpart
to imperial Rome—an image of, and
belonging to, the seven-headed, ten-horned
monster, whose deadly wound was healed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Life was to be given to this image by the
two-horned beast. The papal hierarchy is created
when its supremacy over other churches
is declared and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sustained</span></em>; and the power by
which this is done, is that which gives life to
it. This was done, according to the following
history, by the Eastern empire.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The power of the papacy, symbolized by
the image, had been predicted in Daniel under
the symbol of <span class="tei tei-q">“a Little Horn,”</span> that came up
among the previous <span class="tei tei-q">“ten horns,”</span> before whom
<span class="tei tei-q">“there were three of the first horns plucked
up by the roots: and behold, in this horn
were eyes like the eyes of man, and a mouth
speaking great things,”</span> Dan. 7:8. These
horns were thus explained to Daniel: <span class="tei tei-q">“The
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page195">[pg 195]</span><a name="Pg195" id="Pg195" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon
earth, which shall be diverse from all kingdoms,
and shall devour the whole earth, and
shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.
And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten
kings that shall arise: and another shall
arise after them; and he shall be diverse from
the first, and he shall subdue three kings.
And he shall speak great words against the
Most High, and shall wear out the saints of
the Most High, and think to change times
and laws: and they shall be given into his
hand until a time and times and the dividing
of time. But the judgment shall sit,
and they shall take away his dominion to
consume and to destroy it unto the end. And
the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness
of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall
be given to the people of the saints of the
Most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting
kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and
obey him.”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ib.</span></span> vs. 23-27.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When Paul spoke of the second coming of
Christ, in his first epistle to the Thessalonians,
they understood that it was an event then
imminent. The apostle, in his second epistle,
corrects this impression, by referring to the
foregoing prediction in Daniel, which must be
previously fulfilled. He assures them that
<span class="tei tei-q">“the day of Christ”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“shall not come, except
there be”</span> an apostasy, or <span class="tei tei-q">“a falling away
first, and that Man of Sin,”</span> or the lawless
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page196">[pg 196]</span><a name="Pg196" id="Pg196" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
one, <span class="tei tei-q">“be revealed, the son of perdition; who
opposeth and exalteth himself above all that
is called God, or that is worshipped; so that
he, as God, sitteth in the temple of God,
showing himself that he is God. Remember
ye not, that when I was yet with you, I told
you these things? And now ye know what
withholdeth that he might be revealed in his
time. For the mystery of iniquity doth already
work: only he who now letteth will
let, until he be taken out of the way. And
then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the
Lord shall consume with the spirit of his
mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness
of his coming,”</span> 2 Thess. 2:2-8.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The uniform application of these predictions
to the Papacy, by Protestant writers, renders
it unnecessary to argue this point. That
power began early to be manifested, but its
full development was <span class="tei tei-q">“let,”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, hindered, by
the continuance of the Western empire, which
had to be taken out of its way. Tertullian,
near the close of the second century, in expounding
those words, says: <span class="tei tei-q">“Who can this
be but the Roman state, the division of which
into ten kingdoms will bring on Antichrist?”</span>
And he gives as a reason why the Christians
of his time prayed for the Roman empire: that
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the greatest calamity hanging over the world
was retarded by the continuance of it</span></em>. Cyril
of Jerusalem in the fourth century applied the
passage in the same manner, and says:
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page197">[pg 197]</span><a name="Pg197" id="Pg197" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Thus the predicted Antichrist will come
when the times of the Roman empire shall be
fulfilled, and the consummation of the world
shall approach. Ten kings of the Romans
shall arise together, in different places indeed,
but they shall reign at the same time. Among
these the eleventh is Antichrist, who, by magical
and wicked artifice, shall seize the Roman
power.”</span> A large number of the ancient
fathers interpreted this text in the same manner.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In A. D. 257, 1260 years before the time of
Luther, Stephen, Bishop of Rome, began to
act the pope in good earnest,—excommunicating
those who dissented from the doctrines
of Rome.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In 312, 1260 years before the massacre of
St. Bartholomew in 1572, Constantine became
Emperor of Rome, embraced Christianity, and
terminated the last and bloodiest of the Pagan
persecutions—that of Diocletian, which had
continued ten years. Constantine undertook
to remodel the church, in conformity to the
government of the state, and the unhallowed
union of the two resulted in the dignities of
patriarchs, exarchs, archbishops, canons, prebendaries,
&amp;c., which he endowed with wealth
and worldly honors.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
While paganism was superseded by Christianity
under Constantine, its ceremonies were
not suppressed. The senate was still pagan;
and <span class="tei tei-q">“the title, the ensigns, and the prerogatives
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page198">[pg 198]</span><a name="Pg198" id="Pg198" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of Sovereign Pontiff, which had been instituted
by Numa, and assumed by Augustus,
were accepted, without hesitation, by seven
Christian emperors.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Gibbon</span></span>, v. 2, p. 183.
Gratian became emperor, A. D. 376, and was
the first who refused the pontifical robe. In
378, he invested Theodosius with the Empire
of the East; under their rule paganism was
<span class="tei tei-q">“wholly extirpated,”</span> and the senate was suddenly
converted.—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ib.</span></span> That which hindered
was thus taken out of the way. In 378, also,
Gratian refusing the office, Damasus, the
Bishop of Rome, was <span class="tei tei-q">“declared Pontifix Maximus,”</span><a id="noteref_4" name="noteref_4" href="#note_4"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">4</span></span></a>
and made <span class="tei tei-q">“the sole judge in religious
matters.”</span> All who would not adhere
to the religion <span class="tei tei-q">“professed by the Pontiff Damasus,
and by Peter, Bishop of Alexandria,”</span>
were declared heretics.—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Gibbon</span></span>, v. 2, p. 156.
Damasus, by virtue of his power, introduced
the worship of the saints, and of Mary, <span class="tei tei-q">“the
mother of God,”</span>—excommunicating those
who dissented. Thus the apostasy, by adopting
the gods of the heathen, and the name of
the heathen pontiff, began to be set up, and
the excommunicated church disappeared in
the wilderness.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the ninth century a document was produced,
which claimed to be a deed of gift
from Constantine to the Pope, dated A. D.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page199">[pg 199]</span><a name="Pg199" id="Pg199" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
324, ceding him the city of Rome and all
Italy, with the crown, the mitre, &amp;c.; but the
forgery of this has been fully exposed. With
the removal of the capital of the world to
Constantinople, the empire began to decline;
but the church augmented as fast. A provisional
synod at Sardica, in A. D. 344, and a
decree of the Emperor Valentinian III., in 445,
had acknowledged the Bishop of Rome as the
primate of the five patriarchs, and as the last
tribunal of appeal from the other bishops; but
the edicts of the Pope were often disregarded
and opposed, and he continued subject to the
civil power till the subversion of the Western
empire by Odoacer, King of the Heruli, in
A. D. 476.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The ten kingdoms which had arisen on the
ruins of the Western empire (p. <a href="#Pg169" class="tei tei-ref">169</a>), had
nearly all embraced Christianity, corrupted
by Arianism. And the barbarians transferred
to their Christian instructors, the profound
submission and reverence which they were
accustomed to yield to the teachers of paganism,—many
of the rites and ceremonies of
which had been incorporated into the Catholic
service. Ecclesiastical courts were established,
in which were tried all questions relating
to character, office, or property of the
clergy; and thus they became nearly independent
of the civil judges.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Heruli, which was the first of the ten
horns plucked up, were conquered by the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page200">[pg 200]</span><a name="Pg200" id="Pg200" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Ostrogoths, in A. D. 493, when all Italy submitted
to Theodoric. He fixed his capital at
Ravenna, which left the Pope the only Prince
of Rome; and the Romans, for protection,
were forced to pay more deference to him.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
About A. D. 500, two Popes were simultaneously
elected, when Theodoric gave the
papal chair to Symmachus. Gross crimes
being alleged against him by the defeated
party, the king summoned a council in A. D.
503 to investigate the charges; and he was
acquitted. The other party being dissatisfied,
Ennodius, Bishop Ticonum, drew up an
apology for the Pope and council, in which,
for the first time, the Pope was styled a
<span class="tei tei-q">“Judge in the place of God, and Vicegerent
of the Most High;”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“subject to no
earthly tribunal.”</span> Thus did the Lawless
One attempt, <span class="tei tei-q">“as God,”</span> to <span class="tei tei-q">“sit in the temple

In A. D. 533, Justinian, Emperor at Constantinople,
being about to attack the Vandals
in Africa, and wishing first to settle the religious
disputes of his capital in which he felt
a great interest, he submitted the controversy

in his own favor, or to give force to it, he
acknowledged the Bishop of Rome the Chief
of the whole Ecclesiastical body of the empire;

proceeded to the conquest of Italy, which

4000 soldiers were stationed for its defence;
and they could not oppose the wishes of the
Romans, who voluntarily submitted. Seized
with a momentary enthusiasm, <span class="tei tei-q">“they furiously

In the winter, the Ostrogoths made preparations,
and besieged Rome with an army of
150,000 fighting men. Pope Sylverius was
suspected of treachery, and on proof that he
had communicated with the enemy, he was
banished by Belisarius. At the emperor's
command, the clergy of Rome proceeded to
the choice of a new bishop, and elected <span class="tei tei-q">“deacon

The Bishop of Constantinople did not submit

Boniface succeeded to the Roman See, and
in the following year, A. D. 606, only two
years after Gregory's death, applied to Phocas,—who
had ascended the throne of Constantinople
by the murder of the Emperor Mauritius,—for
the same blasphemous title, with
the privilege of continuing it to his successors.
His request was granted, the Eastern Bishop
was forbidden its use, and the Primate of
Rome was again acknowledged as <span class="tei tei-q">“Universal
Bishop,”</span> and the unrivalled <span class="tei tei-q">“Head of all
the churches.”</span> This title has been worn by

In A. D. 730, Emperor Leo issued an edict
for the destruction of all images used in religious
worship. From that time the Pope
scorned his authority, and acted in defiance
of the emperor's will, who found himself unable
to compel the Pope to obey the edict.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Papacy thus defied all human authority;
but did not as yet attempt the exercise
of political power.

In A. D. 756, Pepin, the usurper of the
crown of France, compelled the King of Lombardy
to cede the exarchate of Ravenna to
the Pope, <span class="tei tei-q">“to be forever held and possessed
by St. Peter and his lawful successors in the
See of Rome.”</span> The Pope had now become a
temporal prince, and one of the kings of the
earth. In A. D. 774, Charlemagne, the successor
of Pepin, confirmed the former gift, and
in addition, subjugated the Lombards, and
annexed a large portion of their kingdom and
the Duchy of Rome to the Roman See. In A.
D. 817, Louis the Pious, granted <span class="tei tei-q">“St. Peter's
patrimony”</span> to the Pope and his successors,
<span class="tei tei-q">“in their own right, principality, and dominion,
unto the end of the world.”</span> Hence, as
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page207">[pg 207]</span><a name="Pg207" id="Pg207" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
a temporal prince, the Pope wears a triple
crown.

In A. D. 800, Charlemagne was solemnly
crowned and proclaimed emperor by the
Pope, having reduced under his sway nearly
the whole of Europe. From this time the
Popes claimed superiority to all kings and emperors,
received homage from them, and exercised
all the rights of sovereignty; but they
were nominally dependent on the Emperors of
the West till A. D. 1278, when the Emperor
Rudolph released the people of the Papal
States from all allegiance they might still owe
to the imperial crown. This act was confirmed
by the electors and princes of the empire.
The Popes, in the greatness of their
power, crowned and uncrowned kings at their
pleasure, absolved subjects from all allegiance
to their rulers, excommunicated whoever they
would, and compelled secular princes to put
to death heretics.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In A. D. 1294, Boniface VIII. became Pope.
From his accession Hallam dates the decline
of the Papacy, which, for <span class="tei tei-q">“more than two
centuries, had been on throne of the earth,
and reigned despot of the world.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dowling</span></span>.
This was 1260 years from the death of Peter,—the
earliest time from which they can date.
His bull of excommunication against Philip
of France, being disregarded by that monarch,
who adroitly made the Pope his prisoner, his
rage brought on a fever, which caused his
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page208">[pg 208]</span><a name="Pg208" id="Pg208" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
death. Only a few succeeding pontiffs claimed,
and none attempted to enforce, the prerogatives
exercised by the preceding Popes. For seventy
years the successors of Boniface resided
at Avignon, in France, and paid great deference
to the monarch of that country. After
this was the Western schism, which divided
the church for forty years,—two rival Popes
claiming the mitre, and thundering out their
anathemas against each other. These events
greatly weakened the Papacy. About this
time appeared Wickliffe and Huss, and Jerome
of Prague; and still later, in 1517, Martin
Luther, in opposition to the Papal pretensions,
published his Thesis against Indulgences,
1260 years from the time of the arrogance
of Pope Stephen.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In A. D. 1572, 1260 years from the removal
of Constantine from Rome to Constantinople,
occurred the bloody massacre of St. Bartholomew,
when in one day 5000 Protestants were
murdered in Paris, and in the same proportion
in other parts of France. The persecutions
of the Papists continued till near the close of
the last century; and as late as November,
1781, a woman was burned alive by the Inquisition
in Spain.

In 1793, 1260 years from Justinian's letter

was entirely suppressed in France. And
in 1798, which was the same length of time
from the establishment of the papacy, by the

conquest of the Ostrogoths,—the plucking up

Berthier entered Rome, compelled the Pope to
flee, and terminated the Papal government.

The temporal power was afterwards restored;

5. It should <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cause</span></em> the infliction of death on
those who should refuse to worship. The
worship it would exact, is doubtless of the
kind bestowed on the wild beast, 13:4. The
Papal hierarchy claimed to be infallible and
invincible, and to have power to bind and
loose on earth and in heaven; those who refused
to recognize its claims, if incorrigible,
were punished with death.

The Image was not to put to death, but
would <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cause</span></em> them to be killed. The symbolization
corresponds with the fulfilment in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page210">[pg 210]</span><a name="Pg210" id="Pg210" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
this particular. The ecclesiastical officials
punished rebellious subjects, by delivering
them over to the civil arm; which punished
heretics according to the will of the Papacy.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Lucius III. and Innocent III. by formal
decrees required them to be seized, condemned,
and delivered by the civil magistrates, to be
capitally punished; and enjoined the princes
and magistrates to execute on them the sentences
denounced by the canon and civil
laws.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lord's Exp. of Apoc.</span></span>, p. 434. This
is substantiated by Bellarmini and other
writers. Civil rulers, who refused to enforce
the decrees of the councils, were anathematized,
excommunicated, and often deprived of
their political power. When the Papacy has
been reminded of the numbers killed and
otherwise punished for alleged heresy, she has
replied that the civil power, and not the church,
has done this! She, however, has caused the
kings of the earth to execute her wishes.

6. The image would cause all to receive
the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mark</span></em> of the Beast. A mark is a token of
recognition. Slaves, soldiers, and the devotees
of various gods, were thus identified on their
hands or foreheads, both before and after the
time of St. John—slaves by the name of the
Emperor on their forehead, and soldiers by
his name on their hand. Mr. Elliott proves
this by quotations from Valerius, Maximus,
Ælian, Ambrose, and others. The devotees
of particular gods gained admittance to the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page211">[pg 211]</span><a name="Pg211" id="Pg211" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
secret meetings of the worshippers of their respective
deity, by a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mark</span></em> by which they identified
each other. At the present day the
Hindoos are marked on the forehead by the
hieroglyphic of the god they are consecrated
to.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The mark of the beast, is its <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">name</span></em>, or the
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">number</span></em> of its name. The ancients often used
numbers to indicate names. <span class="tei tei-q">“Among the
Pagans, the Egyptian mystics spoke of Mercury,
or Thouth, under the number 1218, because
the Greek letters composing the name
Thouth, when estimated according to their
numerical value, together made up that number.
By others, Jupiter was invoked under
the mystical number 717; because the letters
of Ἡ ΑΡΧΗ, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the beginning</span></span>,
or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">first origin</span></span>, which
was a characteristic title of the supreme deity
worshipped as Jupiter, made up that number:
and Apollo under the number 608, as being
that of ηυς, or υης, words expressing certain
solar attributes. Again, the pseudo-Christian
or semi-pagan Gnostics, from St. John's time
downwards, affixed to their gems and amulets,
of which multitudes remain even to the present
day, the mystic word σβρασαξ, or αβραξας,
under the idea of some magic virtue attaching
to its number 365, as being that of the days
of the annual solar circle; and equal moreover
with that of Μειθρας, or Mithras, the
Magian name for the sun, whom they identified
also with Christ. Once more, the Christian
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page212">[pg 212]</span><a name="Pg212" id="Pg212" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
fathers themselves fell into the same
fancies, and doctrine of mysteriousness in certain
verbal numbers. For example, both
Barnabas and Clement of Alexandria speak
of the virtue of the number 318 as being that
of ΙΗΤ the common abbreviation for Jesus
crucified; and partly ascribe to its magical
virtue the victory which Abraham gained
with his 318 servants over the Canaanitish
kings. Similarly Tertullian refers the victory
of Gideon, with his 300 men, to the circumstance
of that being the precise number of Τ,
the sign of the cross. In the name of Adam,
St. Cyprian discerned a mysterious numeral
affinity to certain characteristics in the life
and history of the second Adam, Jesus Christ.
Irenæus notes the remarkable number 888 of
the name Ιησους, Jesus. And in the pseudo-Sibylline
verses, written by Christians about
the end, probably, of the second century, and
consequently not long after Irenæus, we find
enigmas proposed of precisely the same characters
as that in the text;—the number being
given, and the name required.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Elliott's

After the division of the Roman empire, the
western kingdom adopted for itself the name
of the Latin kingdom; and its subdivisions
were called the Latin kingdoms. The church
connected with those kingdoms was also
emphatically called the Latin church. Says
Dr. More: <span class="tei tei-q">“They Latinize everything. Mass,
prayers, hymns, litanies, canons, decretals,
bulls, are conceived in Latin. The Papal
councils speak in Latin. Women pray in
Latin. The Scriptures are read in no other
language under the Papacy than Latin. In
short, all things are Latin.”</span> The Council of
Trent declared the Latin Vulgate to be the only
authentic version of the Scriptures; and their
doctors have preferred it to the Hebrew and
Greek text, written by prophets and apostles.

To receive the mark of the beast, would be
an acknowledgment of subjection to it. The
connection of the beast and its image was so
intimate, that submission to the one, was virtual
submission to the other. To submit to
the rites of the church modelled after the wild
beast, to profess its faith, and to honor its
authority, would be a reception of its mark.

unto Zion, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Thy God reigneth!’</span> Thy watchmen
shall lift up the voice; with the voice
together shall they sing: for they shall see
eye to eye when the Lord shall bring again
Zion. Break forth into joy, sing together, ye

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The standing of the Lamb on Mount Zion,
symbolizes an epoch when Christ shall assume
a corresponding relation to his people. He
there appears in person; and <span class="tei tei-q">“when Christ
who is your life, shall appear, then shall ye
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page219">[pg 219]</span><a name="Pg219" id="Pg219" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
also appear with him in glory,”</span> Col. 3:4.
It will not be till he shall have judged <span class="tei tei-q">“the
quick and the dead at his appearing,”</span> (2 Tim.
4:1), that <span class="tei tei-q">“the redeemed from among men”</span>
will <span class="tei tei-q">“follow the Lamb whithersoever he
goeth.”</span>

The 144,000, who are with Christ, correspond
with the number which are sealed, <span class="tei tei-q">“of
all the tribes of the children of Israel,”</span> (7:4);
and they are doubtless the same persons,
who, under the sixth seal, are designated,
among all denominations of Christians, by the
mark of the living God. They are there
shown to be the godly, who shall be alive on
the earth at Christ's coming and shall then be
changed, and, with the risen dead, caught up
to meet him in the air.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The sealing process there symbolized, is
here shown to be the inscribing of the Father's
name on their foreheads. The subjects of the
beast and its image, receive its mark; but
the children of God and the Lamb, are designated
instead, by the name of the Father.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The voice from heaven as the voice of many
waters, with the voice of harpers, is the
singing of the new song which none but the
144,000 could learn. Those who are translated
at Christ's coming, will be favored above
all, save two, who will have lived on the
earth, insomuch as they will have been redeemed
from the earth without being subjected
to death.

These sing in the presence of the four living
creatures and the elders, who symbolize those
who also are redeemed from among men and
will reign on the earth, 5:8-10. Consequently
those must symbolize the resurrected
dead, with whom the 144,000 will be ushered
into the Lord's presence, 1 Thess. 4:16, 17.
The two bodies of the redeemed, are therefore
both represented with the Lord on Mount
Zion.

Their not being defiled with women, probably
implies that they were not guilty of idolatry,
which is represented by that figure, Ezek.
16:15. They had not submitted to the wiles
of the woman seated on the scarlet-colored
beast, (17:3); had not worshipped the beast
or its image (14:9), and had been true to
their Divine Sovereign.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
They follow the Lamb whithersoever he
goeth. All the redeemed will doubtless thus
follow the Lamb, for of all the <span class="tei tei-q">“great multitude
which no man could number, of all nations
and kindreds, and people, and tongues,”</span>
who stood before the throne and before the
Lamb, clothed <span class="tei tei-q">“with white robes, and palms
in their hands,”</span> (7:9)—it was said: <span class="tei tei-q">“The
Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall
feed them, and shall lead them unto living
fountains of water,”</span> 7:17.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Those who are redeemed from among men,
are called the <span class="tei tei-q">“first fruits unto God and to the

Lamb.”</span> They are not necessarily first fruits
of the redeemed, to distinguish them from
others of the redeemed, but are first fruits of
the race: <span class="tei tei-q">“Of his own will begat he us with
the word of truth, that we should be a kind
of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">first fruits</span></em> of his creatures,”</span> James 1:18.
By his resurrection from the dead, Christ
became <span class="tei tei-q">“the first fruits of them that slept,”</span>
1 Cor. 15:20. And at his coming there is to
be a <span class="tei tei-q">“first resurrection”</span> (20:6), when the
bodies of the saints will <span class="tei tei-q">“be fashioned like
unto his glorious body”</span> (Phil. 3:21), and thus
become the first fruits with their risen Head.
Those who come up at the second resurrection
will not attain to that beatific state.

They are faultless, and without guile. They
are not perfect by reason of any inherent
goodness in themselves; for <span class="tei tei-q">“all we like sheep

redeemed church will be faultless, because its
members will be sanctified and cleansed by
the blood of Christ. Such will constitute <span class="tei tei-q">“a
glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle,
or any such thing ... holy and without
blemish,”</span> Eph. 5:27. While <span class="tei tei-q">“the nations

The era symbolized by the flight of this
angel, has been applied, by different writers
to the epoch of the Reformation, to that of
modern missions, &amp;c. The view here taken,
is that it synchronizes with the preaching of
the gospel to the Gentiles.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The angel flying through the midst of
heaven, doubtless symbolizes a body of men
conspicuous for their position, energetic in
their movements, extensive in their operations,
and urgent in their proclamation,—whose
teachings correspond with this announcement
of the angel.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The message they bear is that of the
everlasting gospel ευαγγελιον, (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">evangelion</span></span>)—which
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page223">[pg 223]</span><a name="Pg223" id="Pg223" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
is, literally, the good news, the glad
tidings; that which brings <span class="tei tei-q">“life and immortality
to light,”</span> 2 Tim. 1:10. It is a message
which foreshadows the resurrection and
coming judgment at Christ's appearing; and
is therefore called <span class="tei tei-q">“the gospel of the kingdom,”</span>
(Matt. 4:23);—the good news of the
glorious kingdom of the Son of God.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is the preaching of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">everlasting</span></em> gospel
which is thus symbolized. It is no <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">new</span></em> gospel;
for, <span class="tei tei-q">“the Scripture foreseeing that God
would justify the heathen through faith,
preached before the gospel unto Abraham,—saying:
In thee shall all nations be blessed,”</span>
Gal. 3:8. And not Abraham alone, but all
the fathers <span class="tei tei-q">“did eat the same spiritual meat,
and did all drink the same spiritual drink: for
they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed
them: and that rock was Christ,”</span> 1 Cor. 10:3, 4.
Of this gospel the Jewish nation and a
few proselytes, were for ages the sole recipients.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Unto them were committed the oracles
of God.”</span> Rom. 3:2. To them pertained
<span class="tei tei-q">“the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants,
and the giving of the law, and the service
of God, and the promises,”</span> Rom. 9:4.
But the time had been foretold when the Gentiles
should come to their light, and kings to
the brightness of their rising, Isa. 60:3.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
With the coming of Christ, and his rejection
of that nation, the gospel, was no longer to be
confined within its former narrow limits. The
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page224">[pg 224]</span><a name="Pg224" id="Pg224" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Savior said to his disciples: <span class="tei tei-q">“Go ye therefore
and teach all nations, baptizing them in the
name of the Father, and of the Son, and of
the Holy Ghost; teaching them to observe all
things whatsoever I have commanded you:
and lo, I am with you alway, even unto the
end of the world,”</span> Matt. 28:19, 20. <span class="tei tei-q">“Go ye
into all the world and preach the gospel to
every creature. He that believeth and is
baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth
not shall be damned,”</span> Mark 16:15, 16.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Then opened he their understanding that
they might understand the Scriptures, and he
said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus
it behoved Christ to suffer, to rise from the
dead the third day: and that repentance and
remission of sins should be preached in his
name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem,”</span>
Luke 24:45-47.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The fulfilment of those predictions and
commands could not be more beautifully and
appropriately symbolized, than by an angel
flying <span class="tei tei-q">“in the midst of heaven having the
everlasting gospel to preach unto them that
dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and
kindred, and tongue, and people.”</span> It could
be no other gospel: for Paul testified:
<span class="tei tei-q">“Though we, or an angel from heaven,
preach any other gospel unto you than that
which we have preached unto you, let him be
accursed. As we said before, so say I now
again, If any man preach any other gospel
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page225">[pg 225]</span><a name="Pg225" id="Pg225" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
unto you than that ye have received, let him
be accursed,”</span> Gal. 1:8, 9.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In accordance with the divine command, to
preach the gospel to all the nations, beginning
at Jerusalem, the apostles began their mission;
and when the Jews rejected their message,
they turned to the Gentiles, and went everywhere
preaching the word <span class="tei tei-q">“according to the
revelation of the mystery, which was kept
secret since the world began, but now is
made manifest, and by the scriptures of the
prophets, according to the commandment of
the everlasting God, made known to all
nations for the obedience of faith,”</span> Rom. 16:25, 26.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The first converts to the faith, comprised
<span class="tei tei-q">“Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the
dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judea, and
Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia, Phrygia,
and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of
Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome,
Jews and proselytes, Cretes and Arabians,”</span>
Acts 2:9-12. When the Jews contradicted
and blasphemed, <span class="tei tei-q">“Paul and Barnabas waxed
bold, and said, It was necessary that the word
of God should first have been spoken to you:
but seeing ye put it from you, and judge
yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, lo,
we turn to the Gentiles,”</span> Acts 13:46. Afterwards
Paul, in writing to the Colossians, refers
to the gospel as that <span class="tei tei-q">“which was preached to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page226">[pg 226]</span><a name="Pg226" id="Pg226" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
every creature which is under heaven,”</span> Col.
1:23.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This gospel was to be preached to those
who dwell on the earth, and also to all nations.
The symbolic earth of the Apocalypse, being
generally admitted to be the Roman empire
under a quiet government, its fulfilment
would require an early introduction of the
gospel there. Accordingly we find, within
thirty years after the crucifixion of Christ, a
flourishing church existing in the metropolis
of the Roman empire, to which Paul addressed
one of his most able letters. In it, he thanks
God that their <span class="tei tei-q">“faith is spoken of throughout
all the world,”</span> Rom. 1:8. The apostle had
then <span class="tei tei-q">“fully preached the gospel of Christ”</span>
from Jerusalem <span class="tei tei-q">“round about [the coast of
the Mediterranean] unto Illyricum,”</span> (Rom.
16:19);—a country on the Adriatic, or Gulf
of Venice. He afterwards visited Rome,
and is supposed to have preached the gospel
as far west as Spain. The apostles spread
Christianity throughout the Roman empire.
Palestine, Syria, Natolia, Greece, the islands
of the Mediterranean, Italy, and the northern
coast of Africa, contained societies of Christians
in the first century. In the second
century societies existed, and Christ was worshipped,
among the Germans, Spaniards,
French, Celts, and Britons, and many other
nations in Europe, and almost throughout the
whole east. In the fourth century Christianity
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page227">[pg 227]</span><a name="Pg227" id="Pg227" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
had become the prevailing religion of the
empire.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In later times the gospel which began to
be preached at Jerusalem, has been extended
to more distant countries, and is still finding
its way to every tribe and people that have
not before heard its joyful sound. Thus has
the light of the gospel nearly encircled the
globe, having been, in one age or another, proclaimed
in every known country—fulfilling
the words of the Saviour: <span class="tei tei-q">“And this gospel
of the kingdom shall be preached in all the
world, for a witness unto all nations; and
then shall the end come,”</span> Matt. 24:14.
<span class="tei tei-q">“And the gospel must first be published
among all nations,”</span> Mark 13:10. It would
not follow from these predictions that it must
be preached at the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">same time</span></em> to all nations,
any more than the light of day shines on
all parts of the earth at once: but all must
have been illumined by it before the end.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In accordance with this view, those who
are finally redeemed to God <span class="tei tei-q">“out of every
kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation”</span>
(5:9), are those who will <span class="tei tei-q">“have washed
their robes and made them white in the blood
of the Lamb”</span> (7:14), in consequence of
this universal extension of the gospel.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The command to fear and give glory to
God, and to worship the Creator of all things
implies that it was to be proclaimed to worshippers
of false gods, and was not a mere
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page228">[pg 228]</span><a name="Pg228" id="Pg228" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
proclamation addressed to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">actual Christians</span></em>.
The Gentiles to whom the apostles preached
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">were</span></em> actual worshippers of such, and needed
to be taught the worship of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">true</span></em> God.
While Paul was at Athens, his spirit was
stirred within him when he saw the city
wholly given to idolatry. <span class="tei tei-q">“Then Paul stood
in the midst of Mars hill, and said, Ye men
of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye
are too superstitious. For as I passed by,
and beheld your devotions, I found an altar
with this inscription: TO THE UNKNOWN
GOD. Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship,
him declare I unto you. God that made
the world and all things therein, seeing that
he is the Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth
not in temples made with hands,”</span> Acts 17:22-24.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Ye know that ye were Gentiles,
carried away unto these dumb idols, even as
ye were led,”</span> 1 Cor. 12:2. <span class="tei tei-q">“For they themselves
show us of what manner of entering in
we had unto you, and how ye turned to God
from idols, to serve the living and true God:
and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he
raised from the dead, even Jesus, which delivered
us from the wrath to come,”</span> 1 Thess.
1:9, 10.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The great motive, to be held forth to induce
men to turn from the worship of idols to that
of God, was the certainty of the approaching
judgment. In accordance with this, the apostles
make constant references to it. The Corinthians
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page229">[pg 229]</span><a name="Pg229" id="Pg229" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
are exhorted to <span class="tei tei-q">“come behind in no
gift; waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus
Christ: who shall also confirm you unto the
end, that ye may be blameless in the day of
our Lord Jesus Christ,”</span> 1 Cor. 1:7, 8. As
Paul <span class="tei tei-q">“reasoned of righteousness, temperance,
and judgment to come, Felix trembled,”</span> Acts
24:25. He said to the impenitent Romans, that
they were <span class="tei tei-q">“treasuring up to themselves wrath
against the day of wrath, and revelation of the
righteous judgment of God,”</span> Rom. 2:5. The
first things which were presented in all their
teachings were <span class="tei tei-q">“the foundation of repentance
from dead works, and of faith toward God, of
the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of
hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of
eternal judgment,”</span> Heb. 6:1, 2. Thus
<span class="tei tei-q">“Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied
of these, saying, Behold the Lord cometh
with ten thousand of his saints,”</span> Jude 14, 15.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As Christ was to judge the world <span class="tei tei-q">“at his
appearing and kingdom”</span> (2 Tim. 4:1), a
reference to his coming always involved a consideration
of the hour of his judgment; and
his appearing was a great incentive to holiness.
<span class="tei tei-q">“For our conversation is in heaven, from
whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord
Jesus Christ,”</span> Phil. 3:20. And <span class="tei tei-q">“when
Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall
ye also appear with him in glory,”</span> Col. 3:4.
<span class="tei tei-q">“For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of
rejoicing? Are not even ye in the presence
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page230">[pg 230]</span><a name="Pg230" id="Pg230" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming?”</span>
1 Thess. 2:19. <span class="tei tei-q">“To the end he may establish
your hearts unblamable in holiness before
God, even our Father, at the coming of
our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints,”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ib.</span></span>
3:13. <span class="tei tei-q">“For if we believe that Jesus
died and rose again, even so them also which
sleep in Jesus will God bring with him. For
this we say unto you by the word of the Lord,
that we which are alive and remain unto the
coming of the Lord shall not prevent them
which are asleep. For the Lord himself shall
descend from heaven with a shout, with the
voice of the archangel, and with the trump of
God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:
Then we which are alive and remain shall be
caught up together with them in the clouds,
to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we
ever be with the Lord,”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ib.</span></span> 4:14-17.
<span class="tei tei-q">“And to you who are troubled, rest with us,
when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from
heaven with his mighty angels, in flaming fire
taking vengeance on them that know not God,
and that obey not the gospel of our Lord
Jesus Christ,”</span> 2 Thess. 1:7, 8.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Not only the apostles, but their successors,
in succeeding ages, have constantly made reference
to the judgment, as the motive to holiness.
Beginning in the days of the apostles,
the same gospel has been continued by a succession
of men to the present time; and those
who are now preaching, or who support those
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page231">[pg 231]</span><a name="Pg231" id="Pg231" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
who so preach the everlasting gospel, in connection
with the warning of approaching judgment,
must be regarded as belonging to the
same body of men symbolized by the angel
flying in the midst of heaven.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Commencing in the apostolic age, sections
of the globe were evangelized—in Asia and
Africa, that have never received the gospel
since, either under the reformers or by modern
missionaries. But beginning with the dispensation
of the gospel to the Gentiles, its fulfilment
is found in China, in Tartary, in Japan,
in Egypt, and Ethiopia, and in lands so remote
that no one can say it has not been almost
universally promulgated.

Roman church, her fall must be understood to
be her loss of power, as mistress of the kings
of the earth; and synchronizes with her displacement
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page232">[pg 232]</span><a name="Pg232" id="Pg232" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
from her position on the beast, as
symbolized in the 17th chapter. The epoch of
her fall, and consequently of the flight of this
angel, is that of the Reformation, when the
corruptions of the Papal See were first exposed,
and it was denounced as the Apocalyptic harlot.
The argument for this application is
given in the exposition of Rev. 18:1, which
is a repetition of the symbol here given, p. <a href="#Pg300" class="tei tei-ref">300</a>.

The cry of this angel synchronizes with the
<span class="tei tei-q">“voice from heaven”</span> (18:4), and follows
the discovery of the corruptions of Romanism.—See
the exposition of that Scripture, p. <a href="#Pg307" class="tei tei-ref">307</a>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The worship of the beast consisted in a regard
for it, equivalent to saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“Who is
like unto the beast? and, Who is able to make
war with him?”</span> 13:4. To worship, is to
manifest homage and respect. To worship
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page233">[pg 233]</span><a name="Pg233" id="Pg233" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
any inferior object, is to bestow on it the confidence
and affection which is due only to
God. It is to trust in it, as invincible, able to
protect, and infallible in judgment. Thus to
regard any civil or ecclesiastical organization,
is to substitute it for Him, by whom the powers
that be are ordained (Rom. 13:1), who
giveth the kingdom to whomsoever he will
(Dan. 4:17), and by whom alone, kings
reign, and princes decree justice, Prov. 8:15.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Whenever any civil or ecclesiastical enactment
conflicts with the requisitions of Jehovah,
that power is worshipped, which is
obeyed in preference to the other: <span class="tei tei-q">“Know ye
not that to whom ye yield yourselves servants
to obey, his servants ye are whom ye obey?”</span>
Rom. 6:16. The worship of God is incompatible
with obedience to any power which
compels a violation of His laws. Due obedience
to government is commanded, when no
question of conscience is involved. When it
is, no forcible resistance to the execution of
the law is permitted; but while God is obeyed,
the penalty of the law is to be meekly endured.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The early Christians chose death, rather
than to deny their Saviour at the command of
Jewish Sanhedrim or Roman emperor. When
Peter and John were commanded <span class="tei tei-q">“not to
speak at all, nor teach in the name of Jesus,”</span>
their answer was, <span class="tei tei-q">“Whether it be right in the
sight of God to hearken unto you more than
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page234">[pg 234]</span><a name="Pg234" id="Pg234" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
unto God, judge ye; for we cannot but speak
the things which we have seen and heard,”</span>
Acts 4:19, 20. In like manner, the Christians
living at the epoch of this angel, were to
be similarly tried, which is implied in the
command, not to worship.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
So soon as the reformers were placed in
direct conflict with the Church of Rome, her
anathemas were hurled against all who assented
not to her mummeries. And the power
of the civil arm was also brought into exercise
to compel obedience to her commands.
Those who maintained their integrity, did so
in opposition to the requirements of the church
and state; while those who submitted to the
state as invincible, or to the church as infallible,
extended to the beast or its image that homage
and regard which was due to God. They
thus acknowledged themselves the servants of
him whom they obeyed, and subjected themselves
to the wrath of God.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The smoke of their torment ascendeth up
for ever and ever, and they have no rest, day
nor night, who worship the beast and his

the wicked are like the troubled sea which
cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire and
dirt, Isa. 57:20.

The <span class="tei tei-q">“rest”</span> of the righteous, is at the advent

On hearing the voice from heaven, the revelator

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page236">[pg 236]</span><a name="Pg236" id="Pg236" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
likeness as the appearance of a man,”</span> upon
<span class="tei tei-q">“the likeness of the throne,”</span> is explained to
be <span class="tei tei-q">“the appearance of the likeness of the
glory of the Lord.”</span> In Dan. 7:13, <span class="tei tei-q">“one like
the Son of man,”</span> who comes to the Ancient
of days, is evidently a symbol of Christ. In
Rev. 1:13, <span class="tei tei-q">“one like unto the Son of man,”</span>
is the one who was alive, was dead, and is
alive forevermore. The same symbol repeated,
must here also be a representative of
Christ.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
His position on a cloud, indicates the arrival
of the period when he is to be manifested
in mid-heaven: <span class="tei tei-q">“Behold he cometh with
clouds; and every eye shall see him,”</span> 1:7.
<span class="tei tei-q">“One like the Son of man came with the
clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of
days, and they brought him near before him.
And there was given him dominion and glory
and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and
languages should serve him,”</span> Dan. 7:13, 14.
<span class="tei tei-q">“And they shall see the Son of man coming
in the clouds of heaven, with power and great
glory. And he shall send his angels, with a
great sound of a trumpet, and they shall
gather together his elect from the four winds,
from one end of heaven to the other,”</span> Matt.
24:30, 31.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The epoch of this manifestation, according
to the above, is that of the last trump, the
second advent, and the first resurrection.

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page237">[pg 237]</span><a name="Pg237" id="Pg237" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

His <span class="tei tei-q">“golden crown”</span> indicates that he is
now to take to himself his great power, and to
reign, <span class="tei tei-q">“when the kingdoms of this world become
our Lord's and his Christ's,”</span> 11:15, 17.
Crowns are symbols of sovereignty. As such,
they respectively denoted the periods, when
the forms of government, symbolized by the
heads of the beast (12:3) and its horns (13:1),
bore rule. Now the diadem is to be transferred
from them, to encircle the brow of
earth's rightful Sovereign.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The sharp sickle in his hand, indicates that
the time of harvest has arrived; and the
act of reaping, the gathering of the harvest.
There are two gatherings symbolized, corresponding
to the two classes of persons who
are to be gathered. <span class="tei tei-q">“The dead in Christ
shall rise first,”</span> and will be <span class="tei tei-q">“caught up to
meet the Lord in the air,”</span> before the wicked
are gathered, 1 Thess. 4:16, 17. <span class="tei tei-q">“I will
come again, and receive you unto myself,”</span>
said the Saviour, John 14:5. The Lord of
the harvest directs its gathering, but effects it
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page238">[pg 238]</span><a name="Pg238" id="Pg238" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
by the instrumentality of angels: <span class="tei tei-q">“He shall
send his angels, and shall gather together his
elect from the four winds, from the uttermost
part of the earth, to the uttermost part of
heaven,”</span> Mark 13:27. When thus gathered,
they are caught up to meet the Lord in the air,
where the Lord of the harvest sits. This
is the separation of the righteous and wicked,
who were to <span class="tei tei-q">“grow together till the harvest,”</span>
which, says the Saviour, <span class="tei tei-q">“is the end of the
world,”</span> Matt. 13:39.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Mr. Lord suggests, that it is inconsistent
with the dignity of Christ, to be notified by an
angel when to begin his work; and therefore
dissents from the application of the symbol to
him. It may not, however, be necessary to
consider the cry of the angel, as one of command.
The angel may be a messenger from
the Ancient of days, announcing the epoch of
the resurrection. Or he may symbolize a body
of men, who will be ardently praying for the
return of the nobleman to take his kingdom.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The harvest is spoken of in distinction
from the gathering of the vine, and in contrast
with it. Men harvest what they prize,—their
grain and fruits. They do not harvest
briers and thorns. They cut or reap both;
but the act of reaping is not expressive of the
destiny of what is reaped. This is indicated
by the disposition made, and the terms applied;
the one is gathered into the garner of
the Lord; but the other is given to the consuming
fire.

The wicked also are gathered by the instrumentality

angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom
all things that offend, and them which
do iniquity; and shall cast them into a
furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and
gnashing of teeth,”</span> Matt. 13:40-42. In the
parable of the tares, the Saviour said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Let

The disposition of the vine, its being trodden

overtake the wicked, after the escape of the
righteous, when they are gathered into bundles

being then caught up to meet the Lord in the

the vine of the earth having been gathered
and cast into the wine-press of the wrath of
God (14:19), they rejoice above the fires
of earth, witnesses of the manifestations of
God's judgments. They have come out of
all their tribulations, and evidently synchronize
with the palm-bearing multitude (Rev.

<span class="tei tei-q">“The song of Moses,”</span> was that sung by

to dwell in,—in the sanctuary which he had
established, Ex. 15:1-21. The analogy

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The temple of the tabernacle of the testimony
in heaven,”</span> must symbolize heaven
itself. It corresponds with the tabernacle
<span class="tei tei-q">“after the second veil,”</span>—called <span class="tei tei-q">“the holiest
of all,”</span> where the tables of the covenant were
deposited by the command of Moses, Heb. 9:1-5.
There, the <span class="tei tei-q">“cherubims of glory”</span> over-shadowed
the mercy-seat,—a type of the presence-chamber
of the Almighty. Consequently,
when it is symbolized as being opened in
heaven, the angels who come out are divinely
commissioned executors of God's purposes.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <span class="tei tei-q">“seven angels,”</span> are the ministers of
the divine vengeance,—the rectitude of
their character and the dignity of their office,
being symbolized by their <span class="tei tei-q">“white robes”</span> and
<span class="tei tei-q">“golden girdles.”</span>
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page245">[pg 245]</span><a name="Pg245" id="Pg245" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The period of time symbolized by the pouring
out of the vials, must be anterior to the
second advent; for in the analogous instances
of God's judgments, he visits his enemies
with plagues previous to the deliverance of
his children. Thus were the ancient Egyptians
visited, before the Israelites escaped from
their power, Ex. 5-11.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The deliverance of the vials to the angels
by one of the four <span class="tei tei-q">“living creatures,”</span> indicates
that the intelligences in the divine presence,
which are thus symbolized, are cognizant
of God's design, and acquiesce in his purpose
to visit the subjects of his wrath with these
plagues.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
By these being called <span class="tei tei-q">“the vials of God's
wrath,”</span> we learn that their infliction is not
corrective, but judicial;—that they are not
agents of mercy, but of vengeance.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The filling of the temple with the smoke of
God's glory, to the exclusion of all persons
during the pouring out of the vials, shows
that during that period, there will be no intercession
with God for him to refrain from the
execution of the purposes thus symbolized.
They are inevitable; and there will be no
supplication for their suspension. When Moses
had finished the type of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Holiest of
all,”</span> a <span class="tei tei-q">“cloud covered the tent of the congregation,
and the glory of the Lord filled the
tabernacle. And Moses was not able to enter
into the tent of the congregation, because the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page246">[pg 246]</span><a name="Pg246" id="Pg246" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
cloud abode thereon, and the glory of the
Lord filled the tabernacle,”</span> Ex. 40:34, 35.
It was only when Moses could enter the tabernacle,
that he could there commune with
God face to face, Ex. 33:9, 11.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The voice from the temple to the seven
angels, shows that the acts commanded are
the subjects of divine appointment,—the
angels simply designating the commencement
of the several judgments.

The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">epoch</span></em> here symbolized, in the very
unanimous opinion of most judicious writers,
corresponds with the commencement of the
agitations which preceded the outbreak of the
first French revolution, about A. D. 1785.
Commencing in France, and extending with
more or less virulence throughout the ten
kingdoms, there was excited an intense uneasiness
of the people respecting their relation
to their rulers. They regarded themselves as
insupportably oppressed and degraded, and
were exasperated to madness against their
respective governments. This, under the
next vial, resulted in the overthrow of the
French monarchy, and in attempted revolutions
in other kingdoms.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As the sea symbolizes a people agitated and
disquieted, the living things in it, must symbolize
those who live on and are sustained by
the people. Consequently, the waters becoming
blood, and the death of the things living
in the waters, symbolize the shedding of the
blood of the people, and the slaughter, by
them, of their rulers and superiors.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The epoch symbolized, would therefore
correspond with the actual outbreak of the
French revolution, to which the agitations produced
by the previous vial had goaded on the
excited people. In their riots and insurrections,
history records the destruction of large numbers
of the populace; and these exterminated
the members of the royal family, and all persons
of rank and influence. A million of
people, according to Alison, perished in the
civil war of La Vendee alone; and thousands
of the nobility and persons of distinction were
ruthlessly slaughtered throughout France,
whose rivers were discolored with the blood
of the slain.

contiguous or more remote communities
surrounding it. These are said to have
become blood, without its being specified that

sea. Accordingly, while the greater portion

for twenty years from 1792, to be deluged

With the overthrow of the French monarchy
under the second vial, there arose new
rulers in France, who usurped despotic powers,
and subjected the governed to most oppressive
exactions. The rich were impoverished,
the nation was robbed, the business of
the country was paralyzed, the obnoxious
were slain, every species of misery and wickedness
abounded, the males were subjected
to military conscription, and hundreds of thousands
of them were sent to subjugate surrounding
nations. The countries they invaded
were also devastated, and oppressed, and robbed
by impoverishing taxations. These continued,
though in a milder form, under the imperial
rule, and all parts of the Roman earth
felt the scorching effects of the devouring heat
of French usurpation. But when Napoleon
passed beyond the boundaries of the Roman
empire, he was met and driven back by the
snow and frost of the Almighty.

Just previous to this epoch, Napoleon had
reached the summit of his power; and the
subversion of his throne, with the restoration

Ancient Babylon was situated on the river
Euphrates, which contributed to the wealth
and greatness of the city, and was a means
of its defence. The kings of Media and Persia,
from the east of Babylon, subjugated it
by diverting from the city the waters of the
river, and entering by its unprotected bed.

Waters, when used as a symbol, are explained
to be <span class="tei tei-q">“peoples, nations,”</span> &amp;c., Rev.
17:15. In the 17th chapter of the Apocalypse,
the angel informs the revelator that he
will show him <span class="tei tei-q">“the judgment of the great
harlot who sitteth on many waters,”</span> (17:1);
which implies that he had already seen a vision
to that effect. He is then shown a woman
on a scarlet-colored beast (v. 3), who is
spoken of as sitting <span class="tei tei-q">“on many waters”</span> (v.
1), and on seven mountains (v. 10), and who
is affirmed to be the <span class="tei tei-q">“great city, which reigneth
over the kings of the earth,”</span> v. 18. Under
the seventh vial, the <span class="tei tei-q">“great city,”</span> which is
<span class="tei tei-q">“great Babylon,”</span> is divided into three parts
(16:19); and the inference is, that the harlot
and ancient Babylon are analogous symbols
of the same organized agency; and, that the
city was here exhibited on the great river
Euphrates.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As a woman clothed with sunbeams and
crowned with stars (Rev. 12:1), and a city
illuminated with the glory of God (Rev. 21:10),
are each symbols of the true church, corresponding
symbols of opposite moral characteristics
are appropriate representatives of a
corrupt and apostate church. As Jerusalem
was the seat of the ancient church, so was
Babylon the seat of her oppressors. The former
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page254">[pg 254]</span><a name="Pg254" id="Pg254" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
is addressed as a woman, and told to put
on her <span class="tei tei-q">“beautiful garments,”</span> (Isa. 52:1); and
Babylon is called the <span class="tei tei-q">“daughter of the Chaldeans,”</span>
and <span class="tei tei-q">“the lady of kingdoms,”</span> (Isa.
47:5): so that a woman, and a city of corresponding
character, may, interchangeably,
symbolize the same object. Consequently, the
<span class="tei tei-q">“Babylon,”</span> and the <span class="tei tei-q">“harlot”</span> of the Apocalypse,
both symbolize the corrupt Roman hierarchy.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Ancient Babylon is described as a harlot,
and is addressed as one who <span class="tei tei-q">“dwellest upon
many waters, abundant in treasures,”</span> (Jer. 51:13);
whose end was to come by her waters
being dried up, 51:36. That city sustained
a relation to the waters on which it was situated,
analogous to that held by the Roman
Catholic church to the people who support
and defend her pretensions. Their alienation
and withdrawal from her support, must therefore
be symbolized by the drying up of the
great river Euphrates, which becomes diverted
into other channels. This is now apparently
being fulfilled in the marked alienation of
feeling from the church of Rome, which is
evident throughout the ten kingdoms. During
the last twenty years, the hold of that community
on the affection of her supporters in
Europe, has been constantly becoming weaker
and weaker. Infidel principles have been extensively
propagated. Her cathedrals have
been comparatively deserted; and her existence
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page255">[pg 255]</span><a name="Pg255" id="Pg255" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
has been endured more as a matter of
expediency than of affection. At the present
moment, probably, the mass of the people
have little confidence in her pretensions; but
it will require a more marked withdrawal
from her support than has yet been witnessed,
to fulfil, in all its significance, the meaning
conveyed in the symbol.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <span class="tei tei-q">“kings of the east,”</span> whose way is to
be thus prepared, are doubtless her enemies,
who, having produced the desired alienation
from her support, will take advantage of her
defenceless position, and hasten her ruin; as
the kings of Media and Persia, in like manner,
subjugated old Babylon.

evident that a <span class="tei tei-q">“mouth”</span> is a symbol of an

The religion of Rome imperial, when symbolized

The character of these teachers, is shown
by the declaration that <span class="tei tei-q">“they are the spirits
of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">devils</span></em> working miracles.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There are two words rendered devils in the
New Testament, viz.: δαιμονιον (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">daimonion</span></span>) or
δαιμων (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">daimoon</span></span>), and διαβολος (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">diabolus</span></span>).
The latter signifies the Devil, or Satan, who
is the same as Beelzebub the prince of the
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">demons</span></em>, Matt. 12:25. He it was by whom
Jesus was tempted in the wilderness, (Matt.
4:1-11); who sowed the tares in the field,
(Matt, 13:39); and for whom, with his
angels, the final punishment for the wicked is
prepared, Matt. 25:41.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The word here, is <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">daimoon</span></span>. It is used, in
different forms, sixty-five times by our Lord
and his apostles; and on no occasion do they
hint that they use the word in a sense different
from its then accepted signification; to
learn which, recourse must be had to the testimony
of the Pagan, Jewish, and Christian
writers of those times.<a id="noteref_6" name="noteref_6" href="#note_6"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">6</span></span></a>

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Hesiod</span></span> taught that, <span class="tei tei-q">“The spirits of departed

from their earthly bodies;”</span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Plutarch</span></span>, that

<span class="tei tei-q">“The demons of the Greeks were the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ghosts</span></em>
and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">genii</span></span> of departed men.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“All Pagan
antiquity affirms,”</span> says Dr. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Campbell</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-q">“that
from Titan and Saturn, the poetic progeny of
Cœlus and Terra, down to Æsculapius, Proteus,
and Minos, all their <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">divinities</span></span> were the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ghosts</span></span> of dead men; and were so regarded
by the most erudite of the Pagans themselves.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Among the Pagans, the term <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">demon</span></span>, as
often represented a good as an evil spirit;
but among the Jews, it generally, if not universally,
denoted an unclean, malign, or
wicked spirit. Thus <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Josephus</span></span> says: <span class="tei tei-q">“Demons
are the spirits of wicked men.”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Philo</span></span> says
that <span class="tei tei-q">“The souls of dead men are called
demons.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“The notion,”</span> says Dr. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lardner</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-q">“of demons, or the souls of dead men, having
power over living men, was universally
prevalent among the heathen of these times
[the first two centuries], and believed by
many Christians.”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Justin Martyr</span></span> speaks of
<span class="tei tei-q">“those who are seized by the souls of the
dead, whom we call <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">demons</span></span> and madmen.”</span>
Ignatius quotes the words of Christ to Peter
thus: <span class="tei tei-q">“Handle me and see; for I am not a
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">daimoon asomaton</span></span>,—a disembodied
demon,”</span>—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>
a spirit without a body.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The foregoing is evidence of the New Testament
signification of the word <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">daimoon</span></span>,
here improperly rendered devils,—spirits of
which, the frog-like agencies are affirmed to be.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Demon worship is a characteristic of the
three religions referred to. As already shown,
all Pagans regarded their gods as the ghosts
of dead men; and the Bible speaks of them
as devils, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">demons</span></span>. Moses says of them,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Even their sons and their daughters they
have burnt in the fire to their gods,”</span> (Deut.
12:31); while the Psalmist affirms that
<span class="tei tei-q">“they sacrificed their sons and their daughters
unto <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">devils</span></span>,”</span> Ps. 106:37. <span class="tei tei-q">“They sacrificed
unto <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">devils</span></span>, not to God; to gods whom
they knew not, to new gods that came newly
up,”</span> Deut. 32:17. Jeroboam <span class="tei tei-q">“ordained him
priests for the high places, and for the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">devils</span></span>,”</span>
2 Chron. 11:15. <span class="tei tei-q">“The things which the
Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">devils</span></span>, and
not to God: and I would not that ye should
have fellowship with <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">devils</span></span>. Ye cannot
drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">devils</span></span>; ye cannot be partakers of the Lord's
table, and of the table of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">devils</span></span>,”</span>—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">demons</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Of the same kind are the gods of the
heathen now. In the Youth's Day-Spring,
for June, a missionary describing the alarm
and grief of the Africans on the Gaboon river,
at the near prospect of a death in their village,
says: <span class="tei tei-q">“The room was filled with
women, who were weeping in the most piteous
manner, and calling on the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">spirits of their
fathers and of others who were dead</span></em>, and
upon all spirits in whom they believe, Ologo,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page260">[pg 260]</span><a name="Pg260" id="Pg260" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Njembi, Abambo, and Mbwini, to save the
man from death. These spirits could not
help them, but they knew of none mightier,
and so called on them.”</span> Mr. White, a Wesleyan
missionary, says: <span class="tei tei-q">“There is a class of
people in New Zealand, called Eruku, or
priests. These men pretend to have intercourse
with departed spirits, ... by which they
are able to kill by incantation any person on
whom their anger may fall.”</span> The Sandwich
Islanders, when they found that Christians
supposed they worshipped the images of their
gods, were much amused, and said <span class="tei tei-q">“We are
not such fools.”</span> They used the idol as an
aid to fix their minds on their divinity. Some
of them supposed their divinity was a spirit
residing in their idol.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Mohammedans, while they recognize
God, are also <span class="tei tei-q">“taught by the Koran to
believe the existence of an intermediate order
of creatures, which they call Jin, or genii;”</span>
some of which are supposed to be good and
others bad, and capable of communicating
with men, and rewarding or punishing them.
The 72d chapter of the Koran consists of a
pretended communication from the genii to
Mohammed. They are made to say: <span class="tei tei-q">“There
are some among us who are upright, and
there are some among us who are otherwise;”</span>
and speaking of men: <span class="tei tei-q">“If they tread
in the way of truth, we will surely water
them with abundance of rain,”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> will
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page261">[pg 261]</span><a name="Pg261" id="Pg261" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
grant them plenty of good things. Thus they
are recognized as dispensers of good. They
bear a striking resemblance to the spirits
which now pretend to communicate with
men! All who are familiar with Arabian
romances know how frequently genii, fairies,
&amp;c., figure as agents in the execution of wonderful
exploits.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Romanists also pretend to communicate with
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">demons</span></span>,—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> with departed spirits.
They deify the Virgin Mary, and supplicate
the intercessions of many departed saints; and
some they supplicate, whose claim to saintship
is somewhat equivocal. Their teachings
in this particular, Protestants generally recognize
as the subject of the following prediction:
<span class="tei tei-q">“Now the Spirit speaketh expressly that in
the latter times some shall depart from the
faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and
doctrines of devils,”</span>—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">demons</span></span>, 1 Tim. 4:1.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Demon-worship being common to Paganism,
Mohammedanism, and Popery, when the
frog-like agency emerges from them, the conditions
of the symbol seem to require that it
shall originate with, but shall pass beyond
and outside the influence of those religions.
The agency thus symbolized, was to <span class="tei tei-q">“go forth
unto the kings of the earth, and of the whole
world.”</span> Its fulfilment requires a wonderful
and an alarming increase of those who teach
and believe these doctrines; and as they are
to work miracles, whereby the world will be
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page262">[pg 262]</span><a name="Pg262" id="Pg262" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
deceived, their teachings are to be accompanied
by extraordinary phenomena, which will
be unexplainable by any of the known laws
of science. The spirits of the departed are
to be recognized by them as authoritative
teachers, who are to be reverenced and
obeyed. They will be regarded as communicating
with mortals, as unveiling the hidden
things of the invisible state, and as performing
acts requiring the exercise of physical
power. The former are evident from
the analogy which exists between this and
demon-worship; and the latter, from the
ascription to them of miraculous acts.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The existence of demoniacal intelligences,
capable of communicating with and acting
on mortals, appears to be in accordance with
the teachings of the Saviour and apostles.
Demoniacal possessions are clearly distinguished
from all diseases; and demons are
shown, by the admissions of the New Testament,
to be actual intelligences, capable of
physical power. When the fame of Christ
<span class="tei tei-q">“went throughout all Syria, they brought
unto him all sick people that were taken with
divers diseases and torments, and those which
were possessed with devils, and those which
were lunatic, and those which had the palsy;
and he healed them,”</span> Matt. 4:24. <span class="tei tei-q">“When
the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he
walketh through dry places, seeking rest, and
findeth none. Then he saith, I will return
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page263">[pg 263]</span><a name="Pg263" id="Pg263" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
into my house from whence I came out; and
when he is come, he findeth it empty, swept,
and garnished. Then goeth he, and taketh
with himself seven other spirits more wicked
than himself, and they enter in and dwell
there: and the last state of that man is worse
than the first,”</span> Matt. 12:43-45. <span class="tei tei-q">“And
as they went out, behold they brought to
him a dumb man possessed with a devil.<a id="noteref_7" name="noteref_7" href="#note_7"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">7</span></span></a>
And when the devil was cast out, the dumb
spake; and the multitudes marvelled, saying,
It was never so seen in Israel. But the Pharisees
said, He casteth out devils,<a id="noteref_8" name="noteref_8" href="#note_8"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">8</span></span></a> through the
prince of the devils,”</span> Matt. 9:32-34. <span class="tei tei-q">“And
when they were come to the multitude, there
came to him a certain man kneeling down to
him, and saying, Lord, have mercy on my
son; for he is lunatic, and sore vexed, for oft-times
he falleth into the fire, and oft into the
water. And I brought him to thy disciples,
and they could not cure him. Then Jesus
answered and said, O faithless and perverse
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page264">[pg 264]</span><a name="Pg264" id="Pg264" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
generation, how long shall I be with you?
how long shall I suffer you? Bring him
hither to me. And Jesus rebuked the devil,
and he departed out of him; and the child
was cured from that very hour,”</span> Matt. 17:14-18.
<span class="tei tei-q">“And there was in their synagogue
a man with an unclean spirit: and he cried
out, saying, Let us alone; what have we to
do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art
thou come to destroy us? I know thee who
thou art, the Holy One of God. And Jesus
rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and
come out of him. And when the unclean
spirit had torn him, and cried with a loud
voice, he came out of him. And they were
all amazed, insomuch that they questioned
among themselves, What thing is this? what
new doctrine is this? for with what authority
commandeth he even the unclean spirits, and
they do obey him!”</span> Mark 1:23-27. <span class="tei tei-q">“And
when he was come out of the ship, immediately
there met him out of the tombs a man
with an unclean spirit, who had his dwelling
among the tombs; and no man could bind
him, no, not with chains: because that he
had been often bound with fetters and chains,
and the chains had been plucked asunder by
him, and the fetters broken in pieces: neither
could any man tame him. And always,
night and day, he was in the mountains, and
in the tombs, crying, and cutting himself with
stones. But when he saw Jesus afar off, he
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page265">[pg 265]</span><a name="Pg265" id="Pg265" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
ran and worshipped him, and cried with a
loud voice, and said, What have I to do with
thee, Jesus, thou Son of the Most High God!
I adjure thee, by God, that thou torment me
not. (For he said unto him, Come out of the
man, thou unclean spirit.) And he asked
him, What is thy name? And he answered,
saying, My name is Legion: for we are
many. And he besought him much that he
would not send them away out of the country.
Now there was nigh unto the mountains a
great herd of swine feeding. And all the
devils besought him, saying, Send us into the
swine, that we may enter into them. And
forthwith Jesus gave them leave. And the
unclean spirits went out, and entered into the
swine; and the herd ran violently down a
steep place into the sea (they were about two
thousand), and were choked in the sea,”</span>
Mark 5:2-13.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In all these instances, the demons are
recognized as actual intelligences, performing
given acts. Without the admission of this,
it will be difficult to explain the meaning of
a large class of scriptures. It cannot for a
moment be supposed that the inspired writers
would be permitted to use language which
should directly mislead the common mind.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Among the miracles which the apostles
wrought, <span class="tei tei-q">“unclean spirits, crying with a loud
voice, came out of many possessed with them,
and many taken with palsies, and that were
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page266">[pg 266]</span><a name="Pg266" id="Pg266" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
lame, were healed,”</span> Acts 8:7. <span class="tei tei-q">“And God
wrought special miracles by the hands of
Paul: so that from his body were brought
unto the sick handkerchiefs, or aprons, and
the diseases departed from them, and the evil
spirits went out of them. Then certain of
the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took upon them
to call over them which had evil spirits, the
name of the Lord Jesus, saying, We adjure
you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth. And
there were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jew,
and chief of the priests, who did so. And
the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I
know, and Paul I know; but who are ye?
And the man in whom the evil spirit was,
leaped on them, and overcame them, and prevailed
against them, so that they fled out
of that house naked and wounded. And
many that believed, came and confessed, and
showed their deeds. Many of them also
which used curious arts, brought their books
together, and burned them before all men:
and they counted the price of them, and
found it fifty thousand pieces of silver,”</span> Acts
19:11-16, 18, 19.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The necromancy, divination, and witchcraft,
forbidden in the Old Testament and
practised by the heathen of those times, were
all of a similar character. A necromancer
was one who had, or pretended to have communication
with the dead,—who sought <span class="tei tei-q">“for
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page267">[pg 267]</span><a name="Pg267" id="Pg267" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the living to the dead,”</span><a id="noteref_9" name="noteref_9" href="#note_9"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">9</span></span></a> Isa. 8:19. They
practised divination in divers ways, but usually
admitted their dependence on familiar
spirits,—the spirits of the departed,—demons.
<span class="tei tei-q">“The king of Babylon stood at the
parting of the way, at the head of the two
ways, to use divination; he made his arrows
bright, he consulted with images, he looked
in the liver. At his right hand was the
divination for Jerusalem, to appoint captains,
to open the mouth in the slaughter,
to lift up the voice with shouting, to appoint
battering-rams against the gates, to cast a
mount, and to build a fort. And it shall be
unto them as false divination in their sight,
to them that have sworn oaths: but he will
call to remembrance the iniquity, that they
may be taken,”</span> Ezek. 21:21-23. They
observed times, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> they regarded some as
lucky, and others as unlucky times for the
commencement of any work,—recognizing
distinctions which God had not made. The
heathen divinities were regarded as more propitious
at some times than others. It is enumerated
among the sins of Manasseh, that he
<span class="tei tei-q">“made his sons pass through the fire, and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page268">[pg 268]</span><a name="Pg268" id="Pg268" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
observed times, and used enchantments, and
dealt with familiar spirits and wizards,”</span> 2 Kings 21:6.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
They practised various arts, whereby they
thought to protect themselves from evil, and
to pry into the secrets of futurity. Because
of these things, ancient Babylon was suddenly
overwhelmed,—<span class="tei tei-q">“for the multitude of thy sorceries,
and for the great abundance of thine
enchantments.”</span> These could not save, as
they supposed. Therefore God said to them:
<span class="tei tei-q">“Stand now with thine enchantments, and
with the multitude of thy sorceries, wherein
thou hast labored from thy youth; if so be
thou shalt be able to profit, if so be thou
mayest prevail. Thou art wearied in the
multitude of thy counsels. Let now the astrologers,
the star-gazers, the monthly prognosticators,
stand up, and save thee from these
things that shall come upon thee,”</span> Isa. 47:12, 13.
All these practices were forbidden by
God, who said: <span class="tei tei-q">“Neither shall ye use enchantments,
nor observe times,”</span> Lev. 19:26.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Those who consulted with familiar spirits
were termed wizards and witches,—the practice
of which was also expressly forbidden.
To make witchcraft a mere pretence, is to
impute to Jehovah the making of laws against
pretences and nonentities. To suppose that
he would legislate against, and inflict capital
punishment, because of mere pretences, is incredible!
God said to Moses, <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou shalt
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page269">[pg 269]</span><a name="Pg269" id="Pg269" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
not suffer a witch to live,”</span> Ex. 22:18. And
to the Jews he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Regard not them that
have familiar spirits, neither seek after wizards,
to be defiled by them: I am the Lord
your God,”</span> Lev. 19:31. <span class="tei tei-q">“And the soul that
turneth after such as have familiar spirits,
and after wizards, to go a whoring after them,
I will even set my face against that soul, and
will cut him off from among his people.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“A
man, also, or a woman, that hath a familiar
spirit, or that is a wizard, shall surely be put
to death: they shall stone them with stones:
their blood shall be upon them,”</span> Lev. 20:6,27.
When Egypt was to be destroyed, they were
left to <span class="tei tei-q">“seek to the idols, and to charmers,
and to them that have familiar spirits, and to
wizards,”</span> Isa. 19:3.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The manner in which the familiar spirit
spoke, was by <span class="tei tei-q">“peeping,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“muttering,”</span> whispering
out of the dust, &amp;c. God said to Ariel,
<span class="tei tei-q">“And thou shalt be brought down, and shalt
speak out of the ground, and thy speech shall
be low out of the dust, and thy voice shall be
as of one that hath a familiar spirit, out of the
ground, and thy speech shall whisper out of
the dust,”</span> Isa. 29:4. <span class="tei tei-q">“And when they shall
say unto you, Seek unto them that have familiar
spirits, and unto wizards that peep, and
that mutter: (should not a people seek unto
their God? for the living to the dead!) to the
law and to the testimony: if they speak not
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page270">[pg 270]</span><a name="Pg270" id="Pg270" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
according to this word, it is because there is
no light in them,”</span> Isa. 8:19, 20.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Saul had put away those that had familiar
spirits, and the wizards, out of the land; but
when he <span class="tei tei-q">“inquired of the Lord, the Lord
answered him not, neither by dreams, nor by
Urim, nor by prophets. Then said Saul unto
his servants, Seek a woman that hath a familiar
spirit, that I may go to her, and inquire
of her. And his servants said to him, Behold,
there is a woman that hath a familiar
spirit at En-dor. And Saul disguised himself,
and put on other raiment, and he went, and
two men with him, and they came to the
woman by night: and he said, I pray thee
divine unto me by the familiar spirit, and
bring me him up whom I shall name unto
thee. And the woman said unto him, Behold,
thou knowest what Saul hath done, how he
hath cut off those that have familiar spirits,
and the wizards out of the land; wherefore,
then, layest thou a snare for my life, to cause
me to die? And Saul sware unto her by the
Lord, saying, As the Lord liveth, there shall
no punishment happen to thee for this thing.
Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring
up to thee? And he said, Bring me up Samuel.
And when the woman saw Samuel she
cried with a loud voice: and the woman
spake to Saul, saying, Why hast thou deceived
me? for thou art Saul. And the king
said unto her, Be not afraid: for what sawest
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page271">[pg 271]</span><a name="Pg271" id="Pg271" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
thou? And the woman said unto Saul, I saw
gods ascending out of the earth. And he said
unto her, What form is he of? And she said,
An old man cometh up; and he is covered
with a mantle. And Saul perceived that it
was Samuel, and he stooped with his face to
the ground, and bowed himself. And Samuel
said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me,
to bring me up? And Saul answered, I am
sore distressed; for the Philistines make war
against me, and God is departed from me, and
answereth me no more, neither by prophets,
nor by dreams: therefore I have called thee,
that thou mayest make known unto me what
I shall do. Then said Samuel, Wherefore
then dost thou ask of me, seeing the Lord
is departed from thee, and is become thine
enemy? And the Lord hath done to him, as
he spake by me: for the Lord hath rent the
kingdom out of thine hand, and given it to
thy neighbor, even to David: because thou
obeyedst not the voice of the Lord, nor executedest
his fierce wrath upon Amelek, therefore
hath the Lord done this thing unto thee this
day. Moreover, the Lord will also deliver
Israel with thee into the hand of the Philistines:
and to-morrow shalt thou and thy sons
be with me: the Lord also shall deliver the
host of Israel into the hand of the Philistines.
Then Saul fell straightway all along on the
earth, and was sore afraid, because of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page272">[pg 272]</span><a name="Pg272" id="Pg272" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
words of Samuel: and there was no strength

Micaiah <span class="tei tei-q">“saw the Lord sitting on his
throne, and all the host of heaven standing by
him on his right hand and on his left. And
the Lord said, Who shall persuade Ahab, that
he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead?
And one said on this manner, and another
said on that manner. And there came forth
a spirit, and stood before the Lord, and said,
I will persuade him. And the Lord said unto
him, Wherewith? And he said, I will go
forth, and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth
of all his prophets. And he said, Thou shalt
persuade him, and prevail also: go forth, and
do so. Now therefore, behold, the Lord hath
put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy

thee,”</span> 1 Kings 22:19-23.

The acts and influences of demoniacal
agencies are apparent from the foregoing; and
the symbolization under the sixth seal, seems
to indicate a revival of those teachings and
manifestations at the present time. Within a
few years, the curiosity of the community has
been excited, and large numbers of persons
greatly interested, in various phenomena,
known as Mesmerism, Animal-Magnetism,
Clairvoyance, Pathetism, Neurology, Psychology,
Biology, Electro-Biology, &amp;c. &amp;c. Similar
manifestations have been before exhibited,
but not in modern times to the extent now
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page275">[pg 275]</span><a name="Pg275" id="Pg275" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
witnessed. These were regarded as harmless
phenomena and independent of any supernatural
agency, till audible sounds were heard
communicating intelligible responses. Then
the claim was set up that these are caused by
departed spirits.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These sounds were first heard near Rochester,
New York, in 1847; and, at the present
time (1852), they are affirmed to exist in
hundreds of places in this country, and other
sections of the globe. They are audible raps,
the cause of which, aside from the hypothesis
of spiritual agency, has never been satisfactorily
accounted for. By these raps, unimpeached
and credible witnesses testify that
correct answers have been given to questions,
the facts respecting which were known to no
one at the time of answering. Since then,
furniture has been seen to move about the
room, and other <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">wonders</span></span>, or miracles, been
performed, by invisible agency, at the command
of mediums to attending spirits,—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>
to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">demons</span></span>. Mediums have written on paper,
as they profess, involuntarily, lengthy communications,
in poetry and prose, the subjects
of which they claim to have been ignorant of,
while the pen they held was moved independent
of their own will. These exhibitions have
been attested by hundreds of credible witnesses.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
By such manifestations large numbers of
persons have given their adherence to these
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page276">[pg 276]</span><a name="Pg276" id="Pg276" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
real or pretended agencies as truthful and
reliable intelligences; whose responses they
receive with the same credence that we do the
revelations of scripture. <span class="tei tei-q">“Circles”</span> are extensively
formed, who have sittings, at stated
times, to receive communications from the
spirits of the departed; and these are enforced
by miracles, audible sounds, the exercise of
physical power, &amp;c.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The reality and the credibility of these
agencies are separate questions. Their reality
is shown by their identity with similar manifestations
of former times. The Bible affirms
the existence of such: <span class="tei tei-q">“For we wrestle not
against flesh and blood, but against principalities,
against powers, against the rulers of the
darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness
in high places;”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“wicked spirits”</span>
in <span class="tei tei-q">“heavenly places,”</span> as the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">margin</span></span> reads,
Eph. 6:12.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. The familiar spirits of old responded in
a manner similar to these. They did <span class="tei tei-q">“peep”</span>
and <span class="tei tei-q">“mutter;”</span> their speech was low out of
the dust; they spoke out of the ground, and
whispered; or, as in the margin, did <span class="tei tei-q">“peep”</span>
or <span class="tei tei-q">“chirp”</span> out of the dust. These <span class="tei tei-q">“rap”</span>
and mutter. They respond from beneath
chairs, tables and floors.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. They exercised similar physical powers.
They threw down and tare the persons they
possessed. They turned the swine into the
sea, &amp;c. These claim that chairs and tables,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page277">[pg 277]</span><a name="Pg277" id="Pg277" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
are lifted and moved at will by an invisible
agency.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. They made similar pretensions to credibility.
Simon Magus gave out <span class="tei tei-q">“that himself
was some great one;”</span> and these, that they
utter divine truths.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. Similar regard was bestowed on those,
which is claimed for these. To Simon <span class="tei tei-q">“they
all gave heed, from the least to the greatest,
saying, This man is the great power of God.”</span>
Yet <span class="tei tei-q">“he had bewitched them with sorceries.”</span>
Similar claims by, and regard for these modern
pretenders to the same art, do not relieve
them from the suspicion of a like agency.
<span class="tei tei-q">“For such are false apostles, deceitful workers,
transforming themselves into the apostles
of Christ. And no marvel; for Satan himself
is transformed into an angel of light. Therefore,
it is no great thing if his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ministers</span></span> also
be transformed as the ministers of righteousness:
whose end shall be according to their
works,”</span> 2 Cor. 11:13-15.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
5. Both have given utterance to some truths.
The legion of demons who were cast out of
the man into a herd of swine, acknowledged
Jesus to be <span class="tei tei-q">“the Son of the Most High God;”</span>
and the pythonic spirit which so grieved Paul,
declared the apostles to be <span class="tei tei-q">“the servants of
the Most High God, which show unto us the
way of salvation.”</span> Such communications
with the invisible world being forbidden, their
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">credibility</span></em> is disproved.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page278">[pg 278]</span><a name="Pg278" id="Pg278" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
They claim that spirits of the departed
are brought into direct and intelligent communication
with the living, who desire to
interrogate them. What more was claimed
by the necromancers of old? Said Saul to
the woman of Endor: <span class="tei tei-q">“Divine unto me by
the familiar spirit, and bring me him up
whom I shall name unto thee,”</span> 1 Sam. 28:8.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
They claim that not all, but only those
persons are mediums who are peculiarly susceptible
to spiritual influences. Wherein,
then, admitting their claims, do the <span class="tei tei-q">“mediums”</span>
differ from those of old, who divined
by a familiar spirit?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Their responses are frequently disproved by
facts; and themselves admit the existence of
unreliable spirits, which communicate like
them. They give contradictory responses,
and mutually criminate each other; but their
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">reality</span></em> is not disproved by any discrepancy,
or want of truthfulness in their responses; for
if they are spirits, none but unclean spirits
would respond in a forbidden manner.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These spirits are to be discredited, because
they preach a different gospel from that
preached by Paul, who says: <span class="tei tei-q">“I marvel that
ye are so soon removed from him that called
you into the grace of Christ, unto another
gospel: which is not another; but there be
some that trouble you, and would pervert the
gospel of Christ. But though we, or an angel
from heaven, preach any other gospel unto
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page279">[pg 279]</span><a name="Pg279" id="Pg279" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
you than that ye have received, let him be
accursed,”</span> Gal. 1:6-9. <span class="tei tei-q">“If any man love
not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema,
Maran-atha.”</span> 1 Cor. 16:22. Said John,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the
spirits whether they are of God: because
many false prophets are gone out into the
world,”</span> 1 John 4:1. Also Isaiah said, <span class="tei tei-q">“And
when they shall say unto you, Seek unto them
that have familiar spirits, and unto wizards
that peep, and that mutter: should not a
people seek unto their God?
To the law and to the testimony:
if they speak not according to this word, it
is because there is no light in them,”</span> Isa. 8:19, 20.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Because of these practices, the nations were
driven out from before the children of Israel.
And with the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">miracles</span></span> to be wrought, the
frog-like spirits are to go forth to <span class="tei tei-q">“the whole
world to gather them to the battle of that
great day of God Almighty.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the time of Abraham, <span class="tei tei-q">“the iniquity of
the Amorites was not yet full,”</span> (Gen. 15:16);
but in four hundred years they had practised
all the abominations for which they were to
be destroyed, and the practice of which God
has expressly forbidden. He said to Israel, in
the wilderness, <span class="tei tei-q">“When thou art come into
the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee,
thou shalt not learn to do after the abominations
of those nation. There shall not be
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page280">[pg 280]</span><a name="Pg280" id="Pg280" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
found among you any one that maketh his
son or his daughter to pass through the fire,
or that useth divination, or an observer of
times, or an enchanter, or a witch, or a
charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits,
or a wizard, or a necromancer. For all that
do these things are an abomination unto the
Lord: and because of these abominations the
Lord thy God doth drive them out from before
thee. Thou shalt be perfect with the Lord
thy God. For these nations, which thou
shalt possess, hearkened unto observers of
times, and unto diviners: but as for thee, the
Lord thy God hath not suffered thee so to do,”</span>
Deut. 18:9-14.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Similar pernicious practices and dangerous
heresies, are to prepare the way for the final
destruction of the nations who reject the claims
of Jehovah. Peter declares that <span class="tei tei-q">“there shall
be false teachers among you, who privily shall
bring in damnable heresies, even denying the
Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves
swift destruction. And many shall follow
their pernicious ways; by reason of whom
the way of truth shall be evil spoken of. And
through covetousness shall they with feigned
words make merchandise of you: whose
judgment now of a long time lingereth not,
and their damnation slumbereth not,”</span> 2 Pet.
2:1-3. And Paul says of that wicked:
<span class="tei tei-q">“Whose coming is after the working of Satan,
with all power, and signs, and lying wonders,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page281">[pg 281]</span><a name="Pg281" id="Pg281" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness
in them that perish; because they received
not the love of the truth, that they might be
saved. And for this cause God shall send
them strong delusion, that they should believe
a lie: that they might be damned who believed
not the truth, but had pleasure in
unrighteousness,”</span> 2 Thess. 2:9-12.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The battle of that great day of God Almighty,”</span>
it would seem, must commence by
a conflict of opinions. Mind will war with
mind, and puny man will stoutly contend
against the truths of the Almighty. In this
revival of demon-worship, the old gods of the
heathen are to be set up against the claims of
Jehovah. His declarations are to be made to
give place to <span class="tei tei-q">“doctrines of demons.”</span> The
teachings of God and of these spirits are to be
brought into direct conflict.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The followers of the spirits have baptized
their new theological dogmas, <span class="tei tei-q">“The Harmonial
Philosophy,”</span> of which <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Reason</span></em> is the
final umpire. Revelation no longer speaks to
them in tones of authority. From the Bible,
it is claimed, <span class="tei tei-q">“the seal of infallibility must be
broken away, before a new light and beauty
can enliven and embellish the mystical disclosures
of any seer, prophet, or evangelist.”</span>
So writes Andrew Jackson Davis, the Poughkeepsie
seer, one of the leaders of this new
school, who complains that <span class="tei tei-q">“owing to the
dogmatism of infallibility, the Bible is taught

<span class="tei tei-q">“The Jewish God,”</span> says Davis, <span class="tei tei-q">“is cruel,

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These <span class="tei tei-q">“Harmonial Philosophers”</span> are antagonistic
to the teachings of Jehovah in
nearly all their theological notions. They
scout the idea that any actual evil exists in
the universe. They deny the existence of the
devil, and of evil spirits. <span class="tei tei-q">“Everything,”</span>
says Davis, <span class="tei tei-q">“is forever progressing in goodness
and perfection,”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ib.</span></span> p. 180. The salvation
of all men, is with them as certain as the
operation of fixed laws. They recognize no
Saviour and no atonement in their system of
faith. The teachings of spirits, and <span class="tei tei-q">“a certain
organization of labor, capital and talent,”</span> they
fancy, <span class="tei tei-q">“will effect the desired cure”</span> for all
actual or supposed ills, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ib.</span></span> p. 178. They recognize
no responsibility in the sinner, but attribute
his wrong-doings to ignorance and accident;
and their laws of right, are the dictates
of their own wisdom.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Their system is essentially Pantheistic, all
things being regarded by them as a part and
parcel of Deity. They argue that <span class="tei tei-q">“every
object which has an existence in the universe
must be in its nature good and pure, on the
principle that the effect must partake of the
nature of the cause, and the stream must be
the corresponding emanation of the fountain
from which it flows.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Elements of Spiritual
Philosophy</span></span>, p. 55. They teach that human
spirits are <span class="tei tei-q">“formed primarily from the animating
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page284">[pg 284]</span><a name="Pg284" id="Pg284" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
essences that pervade the creation,—which
essences,”</span> they say, <span class="tei tei-q">“are the breath
and presence of the Divinity;”</span> and hence
they argue, <span class="tei tei-q">“that there are no spirits which
are intrinsically evil in their nature, and
none which do not present in their inward
depths the reflection of divine purity,”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ib.</span></span> p. 56.
Going still further, they claim that there is no
existing <span class="tei tei-q">“source of positive evil,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“no principle
of this nature in the human spirit,”</span> and
that consequently <span class="tei tei-q">“there can be no evil designs
to emanate from such a source,”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ib.</span></span> p. 60.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These assertions are put forth authoritatively;
for the <span class="tei tei-q">“Elements of Spiritual Philosophy”</span>
are attested by witnesses to be <span class="tei tei-q">“written
by Spirits of the Sixth Circle, R. P.
Ambler, Medium.”</span> And if they are met by
the declarations written by those who spake
as they were moved by the Holy Ghost, they
reply: <span class="tei tei-q">“The Christian who deifies his Bible is
as much an idolater as the heathen who burns
his incense before his household image. It is
surely attributing to the book what the Pagan
attributes to his image.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shekinah, April
No.</span></span>, p. 251. Christianity, they denominate,
<span class="tei tei-q">“learned scepticism, baptized in the name of
Jesus,”</span> &amp;c., <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ib.</span></span>, p. 301. Thus are they warring
against the word of God, and placing
themselves in direct conflict with the Almighty.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

Thus will the day of the Lord come, as a

Because so many will be deceived by the
strange performances of the spirits of demons,
and their miracles so delude the multitude,
Christ's coming will be to them sudden and
unexpected. Therefore the greater necessity
for watchfulness. While this is a predicted
means for lulling the world to sleep, it is
given to the Christian as an indication of the
near coming of Christ, whose advent synchronizes
with the outpouring of the seventh
vial. The blessing pronounced on those who
watch, is an intimation that the people of
God will be expecting Christ's advent, while
others will be taken by surprise: <span class="tei tei-q">“unto them

An earthquake is a symbol of a political
revolution. As this is to be greater than all
preceding ones, it must extend to all nations.
It is during the earthquake, that the cities fall
and the mountains and islands flee away.
This commotion evidently synchronizes with
the <span class="tei tei-q">“time of trouble, such as never was since
there was a nation even to that same time,”</span>
when God's <span class="tei tei-q">“people shall be delivered, every
one that shall be found written in the book,”</span>
Dan. 12:1.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“It is done,”</span> is a declaration indicating the
completion of the work symbolized. It marks
the termination of the events of the seventh
vial, which are described in the verses following:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The great city”</span> is <span class="tei tei-q">“Babylon,”</span> (14:8);
which <span class="tei tei-q">“reigneth over the kings of the earth,”</span>
(17:8); and which John had seen sitting
<span class="tei tei-q">“upon many waters,”</span> 17:1. This was
doubtless seen when he saw the waters of the
symbolic Euphrates being dried up, 16:12.
Babylon, being a symbol of the Roman hierarchy,
its triple division indicates a like
division of the church of Rome, not geographical,
but under different leaders, previous to
its destruction.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The cities of the nations,”</span> must symbolize
other hierarchies, analogous to that of
Rome, of which there are the Greek church,
in Russia and Greece, the Arminian and
Syrian churches, and other corrupt nationalized
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page291">[pg 291]</span><a name="Pg291" id="Pg291" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
establishments. All such will become
disconnected, like Babylon, with the governments
by which they are sustained.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Great Babylon”</span> then comes into remembrance
to drink the cup of the wine of the
fierceness of God's wrath. Because her sins
have reached unto heaven, <span class="tei tei-q">“God hath remembered
her iniquities,”</span> 18:5. This synchronizes
with her destruction, symbolized in Rev.
18:8-23. As the Papacy continues till
Christ's coming (Dan. 7:21, and 2 Thess.
2:3-8), this epoch must synchronize with
that event, when he comes to receive his
chosen ones.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
With the destruction of Babylon, occurs
the subversion of all national authority. As
ecclesiastical hierarchies are symbolized by
cities, the <span class="tei tei-q">“mountains”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“islands”</span> on
which they are situated must symbolize the
larger and smaller governments; and their
removal from their places, their subversion in
the great moral <span class="tei tei-q">“earthquake”</span> which is to
overwhelm them. This synchronizes with
the sixth seal, when they are all <span class="tei tei-q">“removed
out of their places,”</span> (6:14); and it leaves
the inhabitants of earth in a state of anarchy.
It is at this time that the kings and great men
of the earth become aware that the great day
of God's wrath is come, 6:15-17. With
this time of trouble, comes the deliverance of
God's people, (Dan. 12:1); who shall be
caught up together <span class="tei tei-q">“to meet the Lord in the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page292">[pg 292]</span><a name="Pg292" id="Pg292" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
air,”</span> 1 Thess. 4:17. To them the Lord has
said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror
by night; nor for the arrow that flieth by
day; nor for the pestilence that walketh in
darkness; nor for the destruction that wasteth
at noon-day. A thousand shall fall at thy
side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; but
it shall not come nigh thee. Only with thine
eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of
the wicked. Because thou hast made the
Lord which is my refuge, even the Most High,
thy habitation,”</span> Ps. 91:5-9.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The removal of the saints leaves the
wicked exposed to the vengeance of God's
wrath, of which a terrific hail-storm on their
defenceless heads, is an expressive symbol.
The Lord said, by Isaiah: <span class="tei tei-q">“Judgment also
will I lay to the line, and righteousness to the
plummet: and the hail shall sweep away the
refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow
the hiding-place. And your covenant with
death shall be disannulled, and your agreement
with hell shall not stand; when the
overflowing scourge shall pass through, then
ye shall be trodden down by it. From the
time that it goeth forth it shall take you: for
morning by morning shall it pass over, by day
and by night: and it shall be a vexation only
to understand the report. For the bed is
shorter than that a man can stretch himself
on it: and the covering narrower than that
he can wrap himself in it. For the Lord
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page293">[pg 293]</span><a name="Pg293" id="Pg293" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
shall rise up as in Mount Perazim, he shall be
wroth as in the valley of Gibeon, that he may
do his work, his strange work; and bring to
pass his act, his strange act. Now therefore
be ye not mockers, lest your bands be made
strong: for I have heard from the Lord God
of hosts a consumption even determined upon
the whole earth,”</span> Isa. 28:17-22.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This must synchronize with the final conflict,
(symbolized in Rev. 19:19-21): also
with the casting of the vine of the earth into
the wine-press of God's wrath (14:19),
and terminates the battle of <span class="tei tei-q">“Armageddon,”</span>—the
<span class="tei tei-q">“battle of that great day of God
Almighty,”</span> 16:14.

symbolization.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The subject of this vision is announced to
the revelator, by one of the angels who had
the seven vials;—very probably, the seventh.
The harlot is identified as one <span class="tei tei-q">“that sitteth
upon many waters.”</span> Ancient Babylon was
thus addressed: <span class="tei tei-q">“O thou that dwellest upon
many waters, abundant in treasures, thine
end is come, and the measure of thy covetousness,”</span>
Jer. 51:13. She is also described
as <span class="tei tei-q">“The well-favored <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">harlot</span></em>, the mistress
of witchcrafts, that selleth nations through
her whoredoms, and families through her
witchcrafts,”</span> Nahum 3:4. Therefore the
harlot whose judgment is to be more minutely
shown, is the city of the previous vision,
which received the cup of the wine of God's
wrath (16:19), and which probably was
shown to John on the waters of the Euphrates,
(16:12); for the reference indicates that
she had been thus previously exhibited,—the
waters on which she was seated, being the
people, nations, &amp;c., which sustained and
defended her idolatries, 17:15. In the vision
now to be shown John, the Roman hierarchy
is symbolized by Babylon; but it is first
exhibited as:

that John saw <span class="tei tei-q">“rise out of the sea, having
seven heads, and ten horns,”</span> 13:1. The
Roman empire had been symbolized by <span class="tei tei-q">“a
great red dragon,”</span> which also had seven
heads and ten horns. In that vision, crowns
were on the heads of the beast, (12:3);
which indicated that Rome, during the period
thus represented, existed under the forms of
government symbolized by the heads. These
heads, the angel affirms, are the seven mountains
on which the woman sitteth, (v. 9); and
also that they are seven kings (v. 10), or
forms of government. Mountains also symbolize
governments, (16:20); and as the
heads and mountains are the same, they must
alike symbolize the seven forms of government
under which Rome existed previous to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page297">[pg 297]</span><a name="Pg297" id="Pg297" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
its subversion by the northern barbarians,—viz.:
1, the kingly; 2, consular; 3, dictatorial;
4, decemviral; 5, tribunitial; 6, pagan-imperial;
and 7, Christian-imperial. At the time
of the explanation of this vision to John, the
<span class="tei tei-q">“five”</span> first-named forms had passed away;
or, as the angel says, had <span class="tei tei-q">“fallen,”</span> v. 10.
One then was:—Rome then existed under its
pagan-imperial, or sixth head. The other,
the Christian-imperial, had not then come;
but after it came, and had continued for a
time, the Roman empire was subverted by
the irruptions of northern barbarians. Thus
<span class="tei tei-q">“the beast was;”</span> and then, was not for a
season. But afterwards it emerged again
from the sea (13:1), under an <span class="tei tei-q">“eight”</span> form,
which was of the previous seven, 17:11.
When it reäppears, its crowns are not upon
its heads, but encircle its horns, (13:1); indicating
that those governments have the ascendency,
which are symbolized by the <span class="tei tei-q">“ten
horns;”</span> and which, according to the angel,
are <span class="tei tei-q">“ten kings,”</span> which had not received their
kingdom at the time of the vision, v. 12.
These were to be kings in <span class="tei tei-q">“one,”</span> or the same
hour with the beast, and must therefore be
contemporary kingdoms, while the forms symbolized
by the heads, are evidently successive.
They constitute the government of Rome, in
its eighth, or decem-regal form; and symbolize
the ten kingdoms which arose after and out
of the subversion of imperial Rome. Under
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page298">[pg 298]</span><a name="Pg298" id="Pg298" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
this form, the beast goes into perdition, (v.
11):—they continue under various combinations,
till the end of the world, when they
will war with and be overcome by the Lamb
(v. 14), in the great battle of Armageddon,
19:19-21.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The ten contemporary kingdoms have one
mind, (v. 13): they perpetuate the kingdom
of the beast, by adopting similar laws, pursuing
the same line of policy, and assuming
the same powers that the empire exercised.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <span class="tei tei-q">“names of blasphemy”</span> which cover
the beast, symbolize its arrogating the right
to dictate in matters of faith and religious
worship, and to punish those who dissent
from its creed. The Roman hierarchy was
supported by legal enactments against heretics
in all of the ten kingdoms. Those who
dissented from the church were delivered over
to the power of the civil arm, which punished
by imprisonment, confiscation of goods, bodily
torture, and death. The exercise of such
power, was a blasphemous usurpation of the
prerogatives of Christ, and an assumption of
authority over the legislation of God.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
On this beast the woman is seated. As its
rider, she guides it, and is sustained by it.
She is its directing power; and while she is
thus seated, there is no reference to crowns
encircling either heads or horns. All rule for
a time is subservient to her control. Thus
were the ten kingdoms obedient to the Roman
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page299">[pg 299]</span><a name="Pg299" id="Pg299" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
hierarchy,—sustaining, and being controlled
by it. She crowned their kings, and dethroned
them at her pleasure. The religion of the
church was enforced by the sword of the
state; and thus did the kings of the earth
commit fornication with her,—the idolatries
of the church being sanctioned by them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The superb attire of the woman, and the
costly gems with which she is decked, denote
the wealth, luxury, and regal splendor of the
hierarchy which she symbolizes. The cup,
and its abominations in her hand, denote the
false doctrines with which she would seduce
the nations. Her names describe her nature,
and identify her with Babylon; and her intoxication
with blood, indicates her blood-thirsty,
persecuting character, and the delight
with which she would exult over the slaughter
of the saints.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Roman hierarchy was not, however,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">always</span></em> to retain her supremacy over the
nations. She was in due time to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fall</span></em> from
the position symbolized by the woman seated
on the beast; and the kings of the earth were
to hate and burn with fire, her whom they
had recognized as their mistress, and to whose
control they had submitted. The governments
which have sustained her pretensions,
were to cast her off contemptuously. This
has been in progress of fulfilment from the
days of Martin Luther, since which her control
of the ten kingdoms has been only limited
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page300">[pg 300]</span><a name="Pg300" id="Pg300" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and partial. Many of her ecclesiastical estates
have been confiscated, and she has been deprived
of her prerogatives in many countries.
There may, perhaps, be hereafter a more complete
fulfilment of this prediction. It is symbolized
in the following chapter, by:

all the nations have drunk of the wine of the fury of her

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This announcement of the fall of the city,
synchronizes with the same symbolization
in the 14th chapter: <span class="tei tei-q">“And there followed
another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is
fallen, that great city, because she made all
nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her
fornication,”</span> 14:8. The angel, proclaiming
her fall, doubtless symbolizes a body of men,
who shall give utterance to corresponding
declarations.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">epoch</span></em> of this utterance is shown by
the identity of this angel with that of Rev.
10:1-3. They thus correspond: They both
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page301">[pg 301]</span><a name="Pg301" id="Pg301" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
descend from heaven: the one is a mighty
angel, and the other has great power; the one
is enveloped with a robe of cloud, his head is
arched with the rainbow, his face is like the
sun, and his feet like fire, and he stands on
both earth and sea; the other is so glorified,
and occupies a position so conspicuous, that
the earth is enlightened with his glory; and
the one cries <span class="tei tei-q">“with a loud voice as when a
lion roareth,”</span> while the other cries <span class="tei tei-q">“mighty
with a strong voice.”</span> Thus their position,
manner and conspicuousness, are alike. What
was uttered by the angel of the tenth chapter,
is not revealed; but the fall of Babylon being
announced in the eighteenth, it follows that it
was the subject of the angel's utterance in the
tenth.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As the messenger of the tenth chapter appears
subsequent to the sixth, and before the
seventh trumpet; and as, after this epoch,
there were to be prophesyings <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">again</span></em>, before
many peoples, and nations, and tongues, and
kings”</span> (10:11), it follows that the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">time</span></em> then
symbolized must be at an epoch <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">anterior</span></em> to
the end of the world. A corresponding reason—namely,
the command to come out of Babylon,
and the fulfilment of her plagues and
sorrows, which are to intervene between the
cry of the angel announcing her fall and the
time of her actual destruction—proves that
the mighty angel of the 18th of Revelation
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page302">[pg 302]</span><a name="Pg302" id="Pg302" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
must also be at an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">epoch</span></em> having a considerable
period between it and the end.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It follows, that when John saw the angel
of the eighteenth chapter, and <span class="tei tei-q">“the earth was
lightened with his glory,”</span> it did not symbolize
a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">literal</span></em> but a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">moral</span></em> light,—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the light of
truth</span></em>. And as the enlightening of the earth
by its promulgation, pre-supposes a previous
state of corresponding moral <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">darkness</span></em>, it must,
as in the tenth chapter, symbolize an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">epoch</span></em>,
prominent in the history of the world, as a
time when the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">darkness</span></em> of ignorance, error
and superstition, began rapidly to disappear
before the spread of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">light</span></em> of truth and
knowledge.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These considerations point to the epoch of
the REFORMATION, when the midnight
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">darkness</span></em> of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dark ages</span></em> began to be scattered
before the uprising and onward progress
of truth and knowledge. Then appeared a
body of religious teachers, aided by the newly
discovered art of printing, who so brought the
Scriptures out from their obscurity, opposed
the pretensions of the Papal hierarchy, and,
by the clear teachings of the word, so secured
the spread of gospel light and liberty, that
they might appropriately be symbolized by an
angel coming down from heaven, and enlightening
the earth with his glory. The descent
from heaven would symbolize the heavenly
origin of the doctrines promulgated. His
mighty power, and the strong voice with
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page303">[pg 303]</span><a name="Pg303" id="Pg303" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
which he proclaimed his cry, would symbolize
the greatness and earnestness of the movement,
and the mighty results to be effected by
it. This symbolization, twice given, could
only be fulfilled by some great and mighty
movement, like the Reformation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The fall of Babylon is distinct from and
anterior to its destruction, and must correspond
with the fall of the woman from her
position on the beast;—she is no longer to be
the director of, and to be sustained by, the
civil power. The cry of the angel, announcing
her fall, as Mr. Elliot remarks, seems to
be anticipative, and not retrospective. The
denunciations of the Papacy by the reformers
were of a character to fulfil this symbolization.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The year 1300, during the pontificate of
Boniface VIII., may be regarded as marking
the highest eminence to which the Papal power
ever attained. From this period the dominion
of the Roman Pontiffs appeared to be gradually
undermined. Twenty-four years after this
date, John Wickliffe was born, who, together
with his followers, made more vigorous attacks
upon Babylon itself. Some of these declared
Rome to be mystical Babylon, and the Pope
and church there to be Antichrist. These
heralds announced the fall of mystical Babylon,
as the ancient prophets had done that of
literal Babylon, long before the event.—Jer.
51:7, 8. Antichrist and Babylon are identified
in prophecy. In 1518, Luther first suspected
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page304">[pg 304]</span><a name="Pg304" id="Pg304" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
their application to the Papacy; and,
writing to his friend Link, on sending him a
copy of the acts just published of the conference
at Augsburg, he says: <span class="tei tei-q">“My pen is ready
to give birth to things much greater. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">I know
not myself whence these thoughts come to me.</span></em>
I will send you what I write, that you may
see if I have well conjectured in believing that
the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Antichrist</span></em> of whom St. Paul speaks now
reigns in the court of Rome.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At first, Luther and his companions sought
only the reformation of that church. They
had no idea of dissolving their own connection
with it. But when the thunders of the Vatican
were hurled at them, and they found
themselves excommunicated as heretics, they
came to the conclusion that the church of
Rome was <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the Babylon of the Apocalypse</span></em>.
Immediately upon this conviction, they began
to cry, <span class="tei tei-q">“Babylon is fallen!”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In 1520 appeared a famous book, by Luther,
on the <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Babylonish Captivity of the
Church</span></em>,”</span> in which he attacked Rome with
great skill and courage. In Switzerland and
England the reformers considered themselves
as fulfilling this message of the Apocalyptic
angel. Elliot says, <span class="tei tei-q">“They <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">seized on this very
prophecy for application; and, for the first
time</span></em>, upon grounds of evidence sound and
tenable, concluded on the fact of progress
having been made up to it, in the evolution
of the great mundane drama, and on their
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page305">[pg 305]</span><a name="Pg305" id="Pg305" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
own chronological place being already far
advanced under the sixth trumpet, and in
near expectancy of the seventh trumpet, of
the Apocalyptic prophecy.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These denunciations against Mystic Babylon,
and protestations against all her idolatrous
ceremonies and superstitious appendages, were
given, by the great body of the reformers,
within the very bounds of her empire. They
resulted in her loss of power, and of control
over the princes of Europe. In 1526, the
other monarchs becoming jealous of the power
of Charles V., Emperor of Germany, <span class="tei tei-q">“Pope
Clement VII. placed himself at the head of a
league of the principal states of Italy against
him; but their ill-directed efforts were productive
of new misfortunes. Rome was taken
by storm, by the troops of the constable,
sacked, and the Pope himself made prisoner.
Charles V. publicly disavowed the proceedings
of the constable, went into mourning with his
court, and carried his hypocrisy so far as to
order prayers for the deliverance of the Pope.
On restoring the holy father to liberty, he
demanded a ransom of four hundred thousand
crowns of gold, but was satisfied with a
quarter of that sum.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ency. Am.</span></span>, v. 3. p. 76.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
All the Protestant princes of Germany denied
the assumptions of the Pope; and the
powers of western and northern Europe, one
after another, denied their allegiance to him.
In 1798, Pius VI. was taken prisoner by the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page306">[pg 306]</span><a name="Pg306" id="Pg306" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
French, under Gen. Berthier, and died in
exile. When Berthier entered Rome, many
of the cardinals <span class="tei tei-q">“fled from the city on the
wings of terror;”</span> but those who remained
<span class="tei tei-q">“were disposed still to uphold the authority
of the Pontiff.”</span> Finally, however, <span class="tei tei-q">“with
melancholy voice, they pronounced their absolute
renunciation of the temporal government.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Life
of Pius VI.</span></span> His successor
resumed his position. But in 1848 Pius IX.
fled from his own subjects, and was only
restored by French arms. Thus gradually
the Babylonish <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">woman</span></em> became unseated, and
fell from her position on the beast; and,
instead of guiding and directing the civil
power, now only exists by sufferance. As a
city, also, her supremacy was gone. Being
no longer the mistress of the nations, or the
ruling city, the Papal See is in the condition
of ancient Babylon when becoming a dependency
of the Medes and Persians.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
After the fall of ancient Babylon, it became
gradually more and more deserted, until
there was a literal fulfilment of the words of
Isaiah: <span class="tei tei-q">“Wild beasts of the desert shall lie
there; and their houses shall be full of doleful
creatures; and owls shall dwell there, and
satyrs shall dance there. And the wild beasts
of the islands shall cry in their desolate houses,
and dragons in their pleasant palaces,”</span> Isa.
13:21, 22. In like manner the apocalyptic
Babylon, after her fall, and the withdrawal
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page307">[pg 307]</span><a name="Pg307" id="Pg307" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of Protestants from her communion, was to
become the receptacle of corresponding spirits.
Her members were to be more impious than
before, and were to adhere more closely than
ever to her idolatrous practices. The contrast
between these and true Christians would also
be more apparent from the separation which
succeeds her fall, in obedience to:

out, pour out double to her. By as much as she hath
glorified herself, and lived luxuriously, so much torment
and mourning give her; for she saith in her heart, I sit a
queen, and am not a widow, and shall see no mourning.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
So long as the true character of the apostate
church was unperceived, she would contain
many good, as well as a multitude of
bad members. The voice from heaven, indicates
an epoch when there should be a widely
extended and marked separation between
these two classes. Till the time of that separation
should be indicated, the children of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page308">[pg 308]</span><a name="Pg308" id="Pg308" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
God would be justified in continuing members
of her communion; but not subsequently.
The condition of Babylon, at the time of her
fall, indicates that the separation must take
place in near connection with that event; and
the cry must synchronize with that of the third
angel in Rev. 14:9,—which symbolized a
body of men who should insist on such a
separation from the Papacy as that here symbolized.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
After the discovery that the church of Rome
was the Babylon of the Apocalypse, the reformers
began to call on the people of God to
desert her communion; and the formation of
the reformed churches was the consequence.
This was preached wherever the Reformation
extended, and has been continued to the
present time. The Protestant churches have
proclaimed connection with Romanism, an
obstacle to salvation; and have called on its
Christian members to come out from her
abominations. Even the name <span class="tei tei-q">“Protestant,”</span>
was given because of their protestation against
the corruptions of the Papal See.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
After the fall of ancient Babylon, and before
her destruction, the people were, in like manner,
commanded to forsake her. Said Jeremiah:
<span class="tei tei-q">“Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and
deliver every man his soul: be not cut off in
her iniquity; for this is the time of the Lord's
vengeance; he will render unto her a recompense.
Babylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed:
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page309">[pg 309]</span><a name="Pg309" id="Pg309" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
howl for her; take balm for her
pain, if so be she may be healed. We would
have healed Babylon, but she is not healed:
forsake her, and let us go every one into his
own country: for her judgment reacheth unto
heaven, and is lifted up even to the skies,”</span>
Jer. 51:6, 8, 9. And Isaiah said: <span class="tei tei-q">“Go ye
forth of Babylon, flee ye from the Chaldeans,
with a voice of singing declare ye, tell this,
utter it even to the end of the earth; say ye,
The Lord hath redeemed his servant Jacob,”</span>
Isa. 48:20. <span class="tei tei-q">“Depart ye, depart ye, go ye
out from thence, touch no unclean thing; go
ye out of the midst of her; be ye clean, that
bear the vessels of the Lord,”</span> Isa. 52:11.

Sins reaching to heaven, indicate great
wickedness. Thus God said to Jonah: <span class="tei tei-q">“Go
to Nineveh, that great city, and cry against
it; for their wickedness is come up before
me,”</span> Jonah 1:2. And he said of old Babylon:

The punishment of Babylon is proportioned
to her wickedness, and is to be inflicted partially
by the kings of the earth, and partially
by other agencies. The kings were to hate,
and burn her with fire, (17:16); and were
also, when they should see the smoke of her
burnings, to bewail and lament for her, 18:9.
The former passage indicates their agency in
her impoverishment, and has been fulfilled in
the confiscation of her property in France and
England, the spoliation of churches and religious
houses, wherever the arms of Napoleon
extended; the dethronement of the Pope, by
Gen. Berthier, in 1798; the refusal of some
of the powers to permit her to nominate, within
their limits, the candidates for ecclesiastical
preferment, &amp;c. She is thus made to feel her
widowhood,—her divorce from the secular
arm,—and has mourned the loss of her most
devoted children, who have forsaken her communion.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Her final destruction is, however, to be
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">entire</span></em>. She is totally to disappear, like the
sinking of a millstone in the sea. She is to
be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">utterly</span></em> burned with fire; but the lamentation
of the kings over her burning, indicates
that her destruction is to be completed by
other instrumentality than theirs. Probably
the multitude are to be incensed against her,
and will so manifest their hatred that the governments
will neither join in it, nor attempt to
resist it, for fear that the same torment will be
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page312">[pg 312]</span><a name="Pg312" id="Pg312" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
inflicted on them, 18:10. But her existence
is terminated by the brightness of Christ's
coming, 2 Thess. 2:8. Her destruction precedes
that of the kings of the earth, who
mourn her end. The merchants of the earth,
the captains, sailors, &amp;c., symbolize those
who bear a relation to the hierarchy, analogous
to that sustained by such to a great
commercial emporium. They are those who
have the control of her preferments, benefices
and revenues,—who traffic in her indulgences,
and thereby become themselves enriched.
And these articles of traffic are symbolized by
the merchandise which, after her destruction,
no man would buy.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The commerce of this ecclesiastical city, has
been immense,—particularly in indulgences.
The sale of these was reduced to a system,
says D'Aubigné, by <span class="tei tei-q">“the celebrated and scandalous
Tariff of Indulgences,”</span> which went
through more than forty editions. The least
delicate ears would be offended by an enumeration
of all the horrors it contains. Incest,
if not detected, was to cost five groats; and
six, if it was known. There was a stated
price for murder, infanticide, adultery, perjury,
burglary, &amp;c. Polygamy cost six
ducats; sacrilege and perjury, nine; murder,
eight; and witchcraft, two ducats.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The penances of various kinds which were
imposed as a punishment for sin, might also
be compounded for money.

Tetzel, one of Rome's travelling merchants,
told the people of Germany that for <span class="tei tei-q">“a quarter

Daniel, in vision, saw the same persecuting
power symbolized by a <span class="tei tei-q">“Little Horn,”</span> having
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page314">[pg 314]</span><a name="Pg314" id="Pg314" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“eyes like the eyes of a man and a mouth
speaking great things;”</span> and he beheld, <span class="tei tei-q">“and
the same Horn made war with the saints,
and prevailed against them, until the Ancient
of days came, and judgment was given to the
saints of the Most High, and the time came
that the saints possessed the kingdom,”</span> Dan.
7:8, 21, 22. And Paul testified of <span class="tei tei-q">“that
Wicked”</span> who was to be revealed, that he
was the <span class="tei tei-q">“Man of Sin,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“whom the Lord
shall consume with the spirit of his mouth,
and shall destroy with the brightness of his
coming,”</span> 2 Thess. 2:3-8. The destruction
of that which was thus symbolized and
predicted, must, consequently, be at the epoch
of Christ's second coming and of the establishment
of the kingdom of God.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is also at the epoch anticipated by <span class="tei tei-q">“the
souls of them that were slain for the word of
God and for the testimony which they held,”</span>
who, from under the altar, on the opening of
the <span class="tei tei-q">“fifth seal,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“cried with a loud voice,
saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true,
dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on
them that dwell on the earth?”</span> 6:9, 10.
The epoch which they anticipated not having
then arrived, <span class="tei tei-q">“white robes were given unto
every one of them; and it was said unto
them, that they should rest yet for a little
season, until their fellow servants also, and
their brethren that should be killed as they
were, should be fulfilled”</span> (6:11),—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, till
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page315">[pg 315]</span><a name="Pg315" id="Pg315" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
their number should be filled up. As the
destruction of that hierarchy, in which <span class="tei tei-q">“was
found the blood of prophets and of saints
and of all that were slain upon the earth”</span>
(18:24), had just been symbolized (in the
18th chap.), and as these rejoicings are because
God <span class="tei tei-q">“hath judged the great whore which did
corrupt the earth with her fornication, and
hath avenged the blood of his servants at her
hand”</span> (19:2), it follows that the epoch here
symbolized is that to which the saints were
to wait, and that they are now to be crowned
with their reward.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As the destruction of Babylon is a little
anterior to that of the beast and false prophet
(19:20), and is to be destroyed by the brightness
of Christ's coming (2 Thess. 2:8), at a
time when the kingdom is to be given to the
saints of the Most High (Dan. 7:22), it
explains how it is that the kingdom is set up
in the days of the kings symbolized by the
divided toes of Nebuchadnezzar's image: symbolic
of the same as the horns of the beast in
Dan. 7:7, 24, and Rev. 17:3, 12, 16; for
<span class="tei tei-q">“in the days of these kings shall the God of
heaven set up a kingdom which shall never
be destroyed, and the kingdom shall not be
left to other people, but it shall break in
pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and
it shall stand forever,”</span> Dan. 2:44.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The kingdom is therefore commenced previous
to the descent of the Lord to the earth,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page316">[pg 316]</span><a name="Pg316" id="Pg316" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
by the saints being caught up to meet him in
the air. <span class="tei tei-q">“For the Lord himself shall descend
from heaven with a shout, with the voice of
the archangel and the trump of God; and
the dead in Christ shall rise first; then we
which are alive and remain shall be caught
up together with them in the clouds, to meet
the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be
with the Lord,”</span> 1 Thess. 4:16, 17.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This epoch, then, is that of the sounding
of the seventh trumpet; for <span class="tei tei-q">“in the days of
the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall
begin to sound, the mystery of God shall be
finished, as he hath declared to his servants
the prophets,”</span> 10:7. This mystery Paul
thus explains: <span class="tei tei-q">“Now this I say, brethren,
that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom
of God, neither doth corruption inherit
incorruption. Behold, I show you a mystery:
We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be
changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an
eye, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">at the last trump</span></em>: for the trumpet shall
sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible,
and we shall be changed,”</span> 1 Cor.
15:50-54. This <span class="tei tei-q">“saying”</span> was thus written
by Isaiah,—<span class="tei tei-q">“He will swallow up death
in victory; and the Lord God will wipe away
tears from off all faces; and the rebuke of his
people shall he take away from off all the
earth; for the Lord hath spoken it. And it
shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God;
we have waited for him, and he will save
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page317">[pg 317]</span><a name="Pg317" id="Pg317" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
us: this is the Lord; we have waited for
him, we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation,”</span>
Isa. 25:8, 9. It follows, then, that
the voices heard in heaven, shouting <span class="tei tei-q">“Alleluia,”</span>
and ascribing <span class="tei tei-q">“salvation, and glory, and
honor, and power, unto the Lord our God”</span>
(v. 1), synchronize with those heard when
<span class="tei tei-q">“the seventh angel sounded: and there were
great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms
of this world are become the kingdoms
of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall
reign for ever and ever.—And the four and
twenty elders, which sat before God on their
seats, fell upon their faces and worshipped
God, saying, We give thee thanks, O Lord
God Almighty, which art, and wast, and art
to come; because thou hast taken to thee thy
great power, and hast reigned: And the nations
were angry, and thy wrath is come,
and the time of the dead, that they should be
judged, and that thou shouldest give reward
unto thy servants the prophets, and to the
saints, and them that fear thy name, small
and great; and shouldest destroy them which
destroy the earth,”</span> Rev. 11:15-18.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The time of the dead being come that they
should be judged, and the saints rewarded, is
another evidence that this epoch is that of the
second advent and kingdom of Christ, <span class="tei tei-q">“who
shall judge the quick and the dead at his
appearing and kingdom,”</span> 2 Tim. 4:1. Consequently
it must synchronize with that of:

The marriage of the Lamb is at the epoch
when <span class="tei tei-q">“the kingdoms of this world are to
become our Lord's and his Christ's”</span>—when
the Lord God Almighty takes to himself his
great power and reigns, 11:15, 17. Therefore,
in connection, are heard the mighty
thunderings, saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“Alleluia; for the Lord
God Omnipotent reigneth,”</span> 9:16. This
scripture, then, corresponds with that in
Matt. 24:30, 31, when <span class="tei tei-q">“they shall see the
Son of Man coming in the clouds of heaven
with power and great glory; and he shall
send his angels with a great sound of a
trumpet, and they shall gather together his
elect from the four winds, from one end of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page319">[pg 319]</span><a name="Pg319" id="Pg319" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
heaven to the other.”</span> For, <span class="tei tei-q">“when the Son
of Man shall come in his glory, and all the
holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon
the throne of his glory: and before him shall
be gathered all nations: and he shall separate
them one from another as a shepherd divideth
his sheep from the goats—the one on his
right hand and the other on his left,”</span> Matt. 25:31, 32.
Those on his right, we learn
from 1 Cor. 15:51, and 1 Thess. 4:16, 17,
are the elect, gathered by the angels from all
parts under heaven, who are caught up to
meet the Lord in the air—and those on the
left are consequently the living wicked, who
are to be slain by the sword which proceedeth
out of the mouth of the Lamb, 19:21.

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The wife</span></span> who <span class="tei tei-q">“hath made herself ready,”</span>
is shown by the foregoing scriptures to be,
undoubtedly, the church triumphant—the
redeemed, who have been raised out from
among the dead, and the living saints, caught
up together to meet the Lord in the air;
to welcome him in his coming to reign.
These constitute the bride, the Lamb's wife;
for as <span class="tei tei-q">“the husband is the head of the wife,”</span>
even so <span class="tei tei-q">“Christ is the head of the church,”</span>
Eph. 5:23. He <span class="tei tei-q">“loved the church, and gave
himself for it, that he might sanctify and
cleanse it with the washing of water by the
word, that he might present it to himself a
glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle,
or any such thing; but that it should be holy
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page320">[pg 320]</span><a name="Pg320" id="Pg320" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and without blemish,”</span> Eph. 5:25-27. This
accords with God's ancient promises to his
people. Thus Isaiah saith: <span class="tei tei-q">“Thy Maker is
thy husband; the Lord of hosts is his name,
and thy Redeemer the Holy One of Israel:
the Lord of the whole earth shall he be
called,”</span> Isa. 54:5. Also Hosea: <span class="tei tei-q">“And it
shall be at that day, saith the Lord, that thou
shalt call me Ishi,”</span> my husband; <span class="tei tei-q">“and
shalt call me no more Baali,”</span> my Lord.
<span class="tei tei-q">“And I will betroth thee unto me in righteousness,
and in judgment, and in loving
kindness, and in mercies. I will even betroth
thee unto me in faithfulness; and thou shalt
know the Lord,”</span> Hos. 2:16, 19. Thus is
the church <span class="tei tei-q">“espoused to one husband,”</span> to be
presented <span class="tei tei-q">“as a chaste virgin to Christ,”</span> 2
Cor. 11:2.

The epoch of this presentation being here
symbolized, it synchronizes with that part of
the parable of the <span class="tei tei-q">“ten virgins which took
their lamps and went forth to meet the Bridegroom,”</span>
when, the Bridegroom having come,
<span class="tei tei-q">“they that were ready went in with him to
the marriage, and the door was shut”</span>—those
left without, afterwards crying in vain for
admittance, Matt. 25:10. The wife had
been made ready by its having been <span class="tei tei-q">“granted
that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean
and white—[<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">mar.</span></span> <span class="tei tei-q">‘bright’</span>]; for the fine
linen is the righteousness of the saints,”</span> 19:8.

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page321">[pg 321]</span><a name="Pg321" id="Pg321" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
those who cried from under the altar (6:11),
and who afterwards, at an epoch synchronizing
with the marriage of the Lamb,
appeared, <span class="tei tei-q">“a great multitude which no man
could number, of all nations, and kindreds,
and people, and tongues,”</span> who <span class="tei tei-q">“stood before
the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with
white robes, and palms in their hands, and
cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to
our God which sitteth upon the throne, and
unto the Lamb,”</span> 7:9, 10. These were
they of whom one of the elders asked, saying,
<span class="tei tei-q">“What are these which are arrayed in white
robes? and whence came they?”</span> and who
was answered: <span class="tei tei-q">“These are they which came
out of great tribulation, and have washed
their robes and made them white in the blood
of the Lamb. Therefore are they before the
throne of God, and serve him day and night
in his temple: and he that sitteth on the
throne shall dwell among them. They shall
hunger no more, neither thirst any more;
neither shall the sun light on them, nor any
heat. For the Lamb which is in the midst of
the throne shall feed them, and shall lead
them unto living fountains of waters; and
God shall wipe away all tears from their
eyes,”</span> 7:13-17. These had complied
with the condition to the promise: <span class="tei tei-q">“He that
overcometh, the same shall be clothed in
white raiment; and I will not blot out his
name out of the book of life, but I will confess
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page322">[pg 322]</span><a name="Pg322" id="Pg322" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
his name before the Father and before
his holy angels,”</span> 3:5. <span class="tei tei-q">“These are they
which follow the Lamb whithersoever he
goeth. These were redeemed from among
men, being the first fruits unto God and to
the Lamb,”</span> 14:4.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Blessed are they which are called unto
the marriage supper of the Lamb,”</span> 19:9.
Truly are they blessed; for <span class="tei tei-q">“they shall hunger
no more, neither thirst any more; neither
shall the sun light on them, nor any heat,”</span>
7:16. They attain the promised blessing:
<span class="tei tei-q">“Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the
first resurrection,”</span> 20:6. <span class="tei tei-q">“And God shall
wipe away all tears from their eyes; and
there shall be no more death, neither sorrow,
nor crying, neither shall there be any more
pain: for the former things are passed away,”</span>
21:4. So entranced was the apocalyptic
seer at these symbols of the glorified redeemed,
that he fell at his feet to worship the
angel who showed him these things. But
his fellow servant shrank back from the
reception of homage, and pointed to God as
the only object of adoration.

<span class="tei tei-q">“the god of this world”</span> (2 Cor. 4:4), the

to rescue it from the dominion of the
usurper, and deliver it from its present mis-rule
<span class="tei tei-q">“up to God the Father”</span> (1 Cor. 15:24),
who will bestow it on One who is worthy

According to the significance of symbolic
language, Christ is here represented as coming
personally. The heavens open and he appears
in resplendent majesty, in accordance with
the predictions respecting his second advent.
When the clouds of heaven had received the

he who commanded John to <span class="tei tei-q">“write in a book

himself as <span class="tei tei-q">“the Alpha and Omega,

while no created object can adequately symbolize
Him, it would derogate from the dignity
of his character and position to be a
symbol of some inferior object. In all mere
providential interpositions, foreshown by symbolic
imagery, the predicted events are represented
by corresponding acts of symbolic
agents. War between nations is symbolized
by beasts, representatives of the nations, contending
with each other. (See Dan. 8th chap.)
Pestilence and famine are symbolized by analogous
results, and not by Christ's appearing.
When, therefore, he is seen coming in person,
it must symbolize his personal advent.

with the crowns on the heads, which were
the seven successive kinds of government by
which its sovereignty was enforced, 12:3,

sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing
even to the dividing asunder of soul and

The contest being between the Lord and his
armies on the one part, and the wicked nations
on the other, the angel seen standing in the sun
and performing an important act in connection
with the Lord's army, must represent one
of his attending angels; for the acts to be performed
are to be by their instrumentality:
<span class="tei tei-q">“In the end of this world, the Son of man
shall send forth his angels, and they shall
gather out of his kingdom all things that
offend, and them which do iniquity; and
shall cast them into a furnace of fire,”</span> Matt.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
His crying to the fowls of heaven to come
and sup on the bodies of the slain, is indicative
of the certainty of victory and of the entire
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page332">[pg 332]</span><a name="Pg332" id="Pg332" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
overthrow of those who war against the Lamb.
As birds gather on fields of slaughter to feast
on the slain, so a cry to <span class="tei tei-q">“all the fowls of
heaven”</span> is expressive of the extent and
thoroughness of the destruction to be inflicted.
It is the same cry which is made in Ezekiel,
39:17, when the armies of Gog are slain on
the mountains of Israel. The beast and the
kings of the earth symbolize the various governments
in the world. The <span class="tei tei-q">“beast”</span> is that
which had seven heads and ten horns (13:1,
and 17:3), and was a symbol of Rome in its
decem-regal form. It was said of this beast,
it shall <span class="tei tei-q">“go into perdition,”</span> (17:8); so that
under some manifestation, it must continue
till the end of the world: the earth being
<span class="tei tei-q">“reserved unto fire against the day of judgement,
and perdition of ungodly men,”</span> 2 Pet.
3:7. As only in its divided form, the Roman
empire continues till then, the beast is here significant
of the divisions represented by its ten
horns—the governments of modern Europe.
<span class="tei tei-q">“These shall war with the Lamb, and the
Lamb shall overcome them: for he is Lord of
lords and King of kings; and they that are
with him are called and chosen and faithful,”</span>
17:14.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The false prophet,”</span> which is taken with
the beast, is described as the one <span class="tei tei-q">“that wrought
miracles before him, with which he deceived
them that had received the mark of the beast
and them that worshipped his image,”</span> v. 20.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page333">[pg 333]</span><a name="Pg333" id="Pg333" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
This identifies him as the two-horned beast
of Rev. 13. (13:11-17). The two-horned
beast being a representative of the Eastern Roman
empire, when that was subverted by the
Turks it became the seat of the false prophet,—the
Mahometan hierarchy.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The kings of the earth must be the remaining
governments which are not represented by
those two. By their subsequently warring
with the Lamb, it follows that the previous
resurrection and translation of the saints does
not produce a cessation of all government.
Those events may not be apparent to all eyes;
or they may serve only to madden the unbelieving,
and to make them more desperate in
their infidelity.

They gather their armies to war against
the Lamb. They resist his authority. They
will not have Him to reign over them. They
are instigated to oppose him by <span class="tei tei-q">“unclean
spirits like frogs”</span> (16:13), which are the
spirits of devils [<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">demons</span></span>, understood by the
Jews to be spirits of the wicked dead] working
miracles, which go forth unto the kings
of the earth and of the whole world, to gather
them to the battle of that great day of God
Almighty, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ib.</span></span> v. 14. This is when Christ is
to <span class="tei tei-q">“come as a thief;”</span> and they are to be
gathered <span class="tei tei-q">“into a place called in the Hebrew
tongue Armageddon,”</span> 16:15, 16. This was
the name of the valley at the foot of Mount
Megiddo (Judg. 5:19), which was famous as
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page334">[pg 334]</span><a name="Pg334" id="Pg334" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
a valley of slaughter. In it Jehu fought
against Ahaziah and Joram, and slew both
the kings of Israel and Judah, 2 Kings 9:27.
It was afterwards memorable for the death of
king Josiah, when Pharaoh-necho fought
against him, (2 Kings 23:29); so that the
mourning as <span class="tei tei-q">“in the valley of Megiddon,”</span> became
a proverbial expression in Israel for
great mourning, Zech. 12:11,12. It is therefore
significantly applied to the final battle.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus do <span class="tei tei-q">“the kings of the earth set themselves,
and the rulers take counsel together
against the Lord, and against his Anointed;”</span>
but <span class="tei tei-q">“He that sitteth in the heavens shall
laugh; the Lord shall have them in derision.”</span>
For the decree has gone forth: <span class="tei tei-q">“I
shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance,
and the uttermost parts of the earth for
thy possession. Thou shalt break them with
a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces
like a potter's vessel,”</span> Ps. 2:2-9. In this
victory the saints, also, have a part; for it is
written: <span class="tei tei-q">“He that overcometh, and keepeth
my works unto the end, to him will I give
power over the nations, and he shall rule
them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a
potter shall they be broken to shivers: even
as I received of my Father,”</span> 2:26, 27.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As thus predicted, in this final conflict
the nations are smitten, 19:15. Those symbolized
by the beast and false prophet are
cast alive into the burning flame; <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page335">[pg 335]</span><a name="Pg335" id="Pg335" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
individuals constituting the bodies of those
beasts are cast therein: their governments
cease when taken by the Lamb and his
armies. This is in accordance with what
Daniel saw, who <span class="tei tei-q">“beheld, even till the beast
was slain, and his body destroyed and given
to the burning flame,”</span> Dan. 7:11.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The remnant”</span> also are slain; so that there
are none left alive on the earth of all the
wicked. Thus Daniel interpreted to king
Nebuchadnezzar his dream: <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou sawest
till that a stone was cut out without hands,
which smote the image [representing the governments
of earth] upon his feet, that were
of iron and clay, and brake them to pieces.
Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver,
and the gold broken to pieces together, and
became like the chaff of the summer threshing-floors;
and the wind carried them away,
that no place was found for them,”</span> Dan.
2:34, 35. It will <span class="tei tei-q">“break in pieces, and
consume all these kingdoms”</span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ib.</span></span>), according
to the prediction: <span class="tei tei-q">“The nation and kingdom
that will not serve thee shall perish;
yea, those nations shall be utterly wasted,”</span>
Isa. 60:12. <span class="tei tei-q">“And this shall be the plague
wherewith the Lord will smite all the people
which have fought against Jerusalem:

The <span class="tei tei-q">“Dragon”</span> is expressly called <span class="tei tei-q">“that

With the appendages of heads and horns—symbols
of political sovereignty—he is used
in Rev. 12:3, as a symbol of the Roman
civil power, under Pagan rule; and in verse
7, when divested of political insignia, of the
pagan hierarchy. But now, as the beast,
another symbol of Roman civil rule, has been

remaining on earth for him to be a representative
of, and consequently he is here represented
as a symbol of himself.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Of his identity there can be no question:
He is <span class="tei tei-q">“that Old Serpent,”</span> who, being
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page338">[pg 338]</span><a name="Pg338" id="Pg338" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“more subtle than any beast of the field
which the Lord God had made”</span> (Gen. 3:1),
<span class="tei tei-q">“beguiled Eve through his subtlety,”</span> 2 Cor.
11:3. He is also the Devil, by whom our
Saviour was tempted in the wilderness,
(Matt. 4:1-12); and the Satan, whose working
is <span class="tei tei-q">“with all power and signs and lying
wonders,”</span> 2 Thess. 2:9. He is our adversary
the devil, who, <span class="tei tei-q">“as a roaring lion, walketh
about seeking whom he may devour,”</span>
(1 Pet. 5:8); and against whom we are to
guard continually, <span class="tei tei-q">“lest Satan should get an
advantage of us,”</span> 2 Cor. 2:11.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Coëval with the fall, the promise was
given that his head should in due time be
bruised, and he is not ignorant of his doom;
for when the legion saw the Saviour about to
dispossess them of the two men among the
tombs, they recognized him as <span class="tei tei-q">“the Son of
God,”</span> and cried, <span class="tei tei-q">“Art thou come hither to
torment us before <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the time</span></em>?”</span> (Matt. 8:29);
<span class="tei tei-q">“and they besought him, that he would not
command them to go out into the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">deep</span></em>,”</span>—the
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">pit</span></em>, or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">abyss</span></em>, Luke 8:31. The epoch when
he should be there confined, is also shown by
Isaiah to be when <span class="tei tei-q">“the Lord cometh out of
his place to punish the inhabitants of the
earth for their iniquity,”</span> when <span class="tei tei-q">“the earth
also shall disclose her blood, and no more
cover her slain,”</span> Isa. 26:21. For <span class="tei tei-q">“in that
day the Lord with his sore and great and
strong sword shall punish leviathan [the

that crooked serpent,”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ib.</span></span> 27:1. This synchronizes
with the slaying of the remnant
with the sword, when Satan is bound and

years.

His being bound and confined must symbolize
his dejection to a position where he can
have no possible influence over the nations
during the time he is bound. It can be no
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">partial</span></em> restraint, as some theologians hold;
for that is contrary to the conditions of the
symbolic representation. His restraint is
full, complete, and entire. Consequently his
influence, for the time being, will have entirely
ceased. The period of his confinement,
therefore, cannot be one of partial exemption
from sin; but the living will be perfectly free
from all its contagious influences. He is to
deceive the nations <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">no more</span></em>, till the thousand
years shall be fulfilled.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The nations”</span> who are freed from his
influences, and also those whom he is subsequently
to deceive, are not, necessarily, organized
political bodies, under civil rulers, as
they now exist. The original term, εθνος, is
defined by Robinson to be <span class="tei tei-q">“a multitude,
people, race, belonging and living together.”</span>
At this epoch, the national organizations having
disappeared, and the people constituting
them being translated or slain, the only
nations remaining will be <span class="tei tei-q">“the nations of

the influence of Satan will have ceased forever;
and those constituting <span class="tei tei-q">“the rest of
the dead”</span> (20:5), who will not live again
till the end of the thousand years—at the very
time when Satan is to be loosed from his
prison to go out to deceive them, 20:7, 8.

not say I am sick: the people that dwell
therein shall be forgiven their iniquity,”</span> Isa.
33:24. <span class="tei tei-q">“He will swallow up death in victory;
and the Lord God will wipe away
tears from off all faces; and the rebuke of
his people will he take away from off all the
earth; for the Lord hath spoken it,”</span> Isa. 25:8.
<span class="tei tei-q">“For behold, I create new heavens and a
new earth,”</span> Isa. 65:17. <span class="tei tei-q">“And there shall
be no more curse,”</span> Rev. 22:3. <span class="tei tei-q">“For the
Lord shall comfort Zion: he will comfort all
her waste places; and he will make her
wilderness like Eden, and her desert like the
garden of the Lord; joy and gladness shall
be found therein, thanksgiving, and the voice
of melody,”</span> Isa. 51:3.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The removal of the curse is called <span class="tei tei-q">“the
regeneration”</span> (Matt. 19:28), <span class="tei tei-q">“the times of
refreshing,”</span> and of <span class="tei tei-q">“restitution;”</span> which Peter
places at the advent of Christ: <span class="tei tei-q">“whom
the heavens must receive until the times of

spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets
since the world began,”</span> Acts 3:21. He
also places it at <span class="tei tei-q">“the perdition of ungodly
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page348">[pg 348]</span><a name="Pg348" id="Pg348" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
men,”</span> which must synchronize with the epoch
when the beast <span class="tei tei-q">“goeth into perdition”</span> (17:11),
and <span class="tei tei-q">“the remnant”</span> are <span class="tei tei-q">“slain with the
sword,”</span> (19:21); <span class="tei tei-q">“when the Lord Jesus
shall be revealed from heaven, with his
mighty angels, in flaming fire taking vengeance
on them that know not God, and
that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus
Christ,”</span> 2 Thess. 1:7, 8. Says Peter: <span class="tei tei-q">“The
heavens and the earth, which are now, by
the same word [<span class="tei tei-q">‘whereby the world that
then was, being overflowed with water, perished’</span>
v.6] are kept in store, reserved unto
fire, against the day of judgment, and perdition
of ungodly men.... But the day of the
Lord will come, as a thief in the night; in
the which the heavens shall pass away with
a great noise, and the elements shall melt
with fervent heat, the earth also; and the
works that are therein shall be burned up....
Nevertheless, we, according to his promise,
look for new heavens and a new earth,
wherein dwelleth righteousness,”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-q">“righteous
persons”</span>—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Horsely</span></span>, 2 Pet. 3:7-13.
This harmonizes with the day that <span class="tei tei-q">“cometh
that shall burn as an oven,”</span> when <span class="tei tei-q">“all the
proud, yea, and all that do wickedly”</span> shall be
burned up, and become <span class="tei tei-q">“ashes under the
soles”</span> of those on whom <span class="tei tei-q">“shall the Sun of
righteousness arise,”</span> (Mal. 4:1-3); which
must be the time intervening between the
resurrection of the righteous and that of the
wicked. This also harmonizes with the testimony
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page349">[pg 349]</span><a name="Pg349" id="Pg349" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of our Saviour, that when, <span class="tei tei-q">“in the
end of this world,”</span> He <span class="tei tei-q">“shall send forth his
angels and gather out of his kingdom all
things that offend, and them which do iniquity,
and shall cast them into a furnace of
fire; ... <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">then</span></em> shall the righteous shine forth
as the sun in the kingdom of their Father,”</span>
Matt. 13:40-43.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The earth being cleansed, and all things
made new, it will have been prepared for the
<span class="tei tei-q">“dwelling”</span> of <span class="tei tei-q">“righteous persons”</span> (2 Pet. 3:13),
who,—having <span class="tei tei-q">“put on incorruption”</span>
(1 Cor. 15:53), and been <span class="tei tei-q">“caught up ... in

</span></div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Thrones”</span> are symbols of power. As the
saints are to reign with Christ on the renewed
earth, in obedience to the invitation: <span class="tei tei-q">“Come
ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom
prepared for you from the foundation of the
world,”</span> (Matt. 25:34); their being inducted
into the kingdom is symbolized by their being
seated on thrones. Thus they sing in the
<span class="tei tei-q">“new song,”</span> addressed to Christ: <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou
wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by
thy blood, out of every kindred, and tongue,
and people, and nation, and hast made us
unto our God kings and priests: and we shall
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page351">[pg 351]</span><a name="Pg351" id="Pg351" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
reign on the earth,”</span> 5:9, 10. In the first
chapter, also, all who ascribe praises to <span class="tei tei-q">“Him
that loved us, and washed us from our sins in
his own blood,”</span> also add: <span class="tei tei-q">“and hath made
us kings and priests unto God, and his Father,”</span>
1:5, 6.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
All the saints being thus exalted to kingly
and priestly dignity, symbolizes the exalted
rank they are to hold in the new creation—the
symbols of their station being taken from
the most exalted offices known on earth.
Thus God said to ancient Israel: <span class="tei tei-q">“Ye shall
be unto me a kingdom of priests, and a holy
nation,”</span> (Ex. 19:6); and the Christian church
is addressed as <span class="tei tei-q">“a chosen generation, a royal
priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar people,”</span>
1 Pet. 2:9.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The time when the saints shall reign on the
earth is in connection with the destruction of
the <span class="tei tei-q">“little horn”</span> of Daniel's <span class="tei tei-q">“fourth beast,”</span>
which, as he saw, <span class="tei tei-q">“made war with the saints
and prevailed against them, until the Ancient
of days came, and judgment was given to the
saints of the Most High, and the time came
that the saints possessed the kingdom,”</span> Dan. 7:21, 22.
<span class="tei tei-q">“The saints of the Most High
shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom
forever, even forever and ever,”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ib.</span></span> v. 18.
<span class="tei tei-q">“And the kingdom and dominion and the
greatness of the kingdom under the whole
heaven, shall be given to the people of the
saints of the Most High, whose kingdom is
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page352">[pg 352]</span><a name="Pg352" id="Pg352" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions
shall serve and obey him,”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ib.</span></span> v. 27. <span class="tei tei-q">“And
they shall reign forever and ever,”</span> 22:5.
Thus the Saviour said: <span class="tei tei-q">“Fear not, little
flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure
to give you the kingdom,”</span> Luke 12:32.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Those who receive the kingdom are symbolized
by the souls of martyrs, &amp;c., living
again and reigning with Christ. The symbol
includes, with the martyred saints, those
who had stood aloof from the worship of the
beast and his image, and those who had not
received his mark; who are shown by a parallel
scripture to represent all who are redeemed
to God <span class="tei tei-q">“out of every kindred, and tongue,
and people, and nation,”</span> 5:9, 10. Some of
these were symbolized, under the fifth seal, as
crying from under the altar in anticipation
of this day, 6:9. Now, with <span class="tei tei-q">“their fellow
servants,”</span> they receive their reward.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The souls of the departed living again, can
only symbolize those who have been subjected
to death, and are again raised. Consequently
they are the subjects of a real resurrection.
And this is shown by the explanation of the
symbol, which affirms that, <span class="tei tei-q">“This is the first
resurrection.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is denied by many that a literal resurrection
is here taught; but in so doing they
deny the faith of the church in its best and
purest ages. In the first two centuries after
Christ, there was not an individual, who believed
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page353">[pg 353]</span><a name="Pg353" id="Pg353" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in any resurrection of the dead whose
name or memory has survived to the present
time, who denied that the resurrection of the
just is here taught.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Eusebius, who opposed this view, quotes
Papias, who he admits was a disciple of St.
John and a companion of Polycarp, as saying
that <span class="tei tei-q">“after the resurrection of the dead the
kingdom of Christ shall be established corporeally
on this earth.”</span> And Jerome, another
opposer, quotes from him that <span class="tei tei-q">“he had the
apostles for his authors; and that he considered
what Andrew, what Peter said, what
Philip, what Thomas said, and other disciples
of the Lord.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Polycarp was another of John's disciples;
and Irenæus testifies in an epistle to Florinus,
that he had seen Polycarp, <span class="tei tei-q">“who related his
conversation with John and others who had
seen the Lord, and how he related their sayings,
and the things he had heard of them
concerning the Lord, both concerning his
miracles and doctrine, as he had received
them from the Lord of life; all of which
Polycarp related agreeable to the scriptures.”</span>
Following such a teacher, Irenæus taught that
at the resurrection of the just, the meek should
inherit the earth; and that then would be fulfilled
the promise which God made to Abraham.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Justin Martyr, born A. D. 89, says that,
<span class="tei tei-q">“A certain man <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">among us</span></em>, whose name is
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page354">[pg 354]</span><a name="Pg354" id="Pg354" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
John, being one of the twelve apostles of
Christ, in that Revelation which was shown
him, prophesied that those who believe in our
Christ shall fulfil a thousand years at Jerusalem.”</span>
He affirms that himself <span class="tei tei-q">“and many
others are of this mind”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“that Christ shall
reign personally on earth;”</span> and that <span class="tei tei-q">“all
who were accounted orthodox so believed.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Tertullian, about A. D. 180, says it was a
custom for Christians to pray that they might
have part in the first resurrection. And
Cyprian, about 220, says that Christians <span class="tei tei-q">“had
a thirst for martyrdom that they might obtain
a better resurrection.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Mosheim assures us that the opinion <span class="tei tei-q">“that
Christ was to come and reign 1000 years
among men,”</span> had, before the time of Origen,
about the middle of the 3d century, <span class="tei tei-q">“met
with no opposition.”</span> And it is the testimony
of ecclesiastical historians, that the first who
opposed it, seeing no way of avoiding the
meaning of the words in Rev. 20th, denied
the authenticity of the Apocalypse, and claimed
that it was written by one Cerenthus, a
heretic, for the very purpose of sustaining
what they called <span class="tei tei-q">“his fiction of the reign of
Christ on earth.”</span> This doctrine is not <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">now</span></em>
evaded in this way, but by spiritualizing the
language of the Apocalypse, and thus finding
a meaning in it which is not expressed
by any of the admitted laws of language.
Theologians who thus reason make the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page355">[pg 355]</span><a name="Pg355" id="Pg355" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
first resurrection the conversion of the world.
But those who are affirmed to be raised, are
persons who have lived and are dead. If
the resurrection is a mere metaphor, then the
martyrs must have metaphorically died, and
must have comprised only those who had been
previously converted and were fallen away.
The rest of the dead must then be understood
as persons morally dead, which would be inconsistent
with the idea of a converted world.
Those who were raised being those who were
previously converted, they must have been
literally dead, and the only resurrection predicable
of such is a literal resurrection.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Bible teaches such a resurrection of
the righteous prior to that of the wicked.
Thus the Psalmist says of them: <span class="tei tei-q">“Like
sheep they are laid in the grave; death shall
feed on them, and the upright shall have dominion
over them in the morning.”</span> But of
himself he says: <span class="tei tei-q">“But God will redeem my
soul from the power of the grave,”</span> Psa. 49:14,
15. Of the wicked Isaiah testifies: <span class="tei tei-q">“They
are dead, they shall not live; they are deceased,
they shall not rise,”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> with the
righteous; but to Zion he says: <span class="tei tei-q">“Thy dead
men shall live, together with my dead body
shall they arise. Awake and sing, ye that
dwell in the dust: for thy dew is as the dew
of herbs, and the earth shall cast out her
dead,”</span> Isa. 26:14, 19. To the same import
is the prophecy of Daniel, respecting the time
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page356">[pg 356]</span><a name="Pg356" id="Pg356" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
when Michael shall stand up, and <span class="tei tei-q">“thy people
shall be delivered, every one that shall be
found written in the book. And many of
them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall
awake, some, [the awakened, shall be] to everlasting
life, and some, [the unawakened, shall
be] to shame and everlasting contempt,”</span> Dan.
12:1, 2. Such, according to Prof. Bush, is the
precise rendering of the original.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The New Testament also teaches a resurrection
of the just, in distinction from that of the
wicked. Paul says, while all are to be made
alive, that it will be <span class="tei tei-q">“every man in his own
order,”</span> or band—<span class="tei tei-q">“Christ the first fruits;
afterwards they that are Christ's at his coming,”</span>
1 Cor. 15:23. None others are spoken
of as being raised at that epoch. When the
Lord descends from heaven with a shout, at
the trump of God, not the entire mass of the
dead, but <span class="tei tei-q">“the dead in Christ shall rise first,”</span>
before the righteous living are changed, 1
Thess. 4:16. In accordance with this priority
in the resurrection of the righteous, Paul
teaches that the worthies who died in faith
<span class="tei tei-q">“accepted not deliverance, that they might
obtain <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a better</span></em> resurrection,”</span> (Heb. 11:13);
and himself, he says, counted all things loss
for Christ, <span class="tei tei-q">“if by any means I might attain
unto the resurrection of the dead,”</span> (Phil. 3:11);
which is <span class="tei tei-q">“the resurrection from among
the dead”</span>—it being a resurrection to which
some will not attain. Thus also the Saviour
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page357">[pg 357]</span><a name="Pg357" id="Pg357" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
taught: while <span class="tei tei-q">“they that have done good
shall come forth <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">at</span></em> [as it is literally] the resurrection
of life, and they that have done evil
at the resurrection of damnation”</span> (John 5:29),
the two are not co-etaneous; for the
righteous shall be <span class="tei tei-q">“recompensed at the resurrection
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">of the just</span></em>,”</span> Lu. 14:14. That must
be the resurrection of which those are the subjects
who receive the kingdom; for <span class="tei tei-q">“flesh and
blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God,”</span> 1
Cor. 15:50. While <span class="tei tei-q">“the children of this
world marry and are given in marriage,”</span>
<span class="tei tei-q">“they which shall be accounted worthy to
obtain that world, and the resurrection <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">from</span></em>
the dead, neither marry, nor are given in
marriage; neither can they die any more: for
they are equal unto the angels, and are the
children of God, being the children of the
resurrection,”</span> Lu. 20:34-36.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The children of the resurrection thus include
all who attain unto that world, which,
consequently, the wicked do not obtain, and
of which the righteous dead and the living
saints are made equal subjects, according
to Paul's <span class="tei tei-q">“mystery:”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“We shall not all
sleep, but we shall all be changed, in a
moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the
last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and
the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and
we shall be changed,”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, to the same
incorruptible state to which the dead are
raised, (1 Cor. 15:50-54); so that all the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page358">[pg 358]</span><a name="Pg358" id="Pg358" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
righteous will alike <span class="tei tei-q">“bear the image of the
heavenly”</span> (v. 49) when they <span class="tei tei-q">“shall be caught
up together”</span> (1 Thess. 4:16) <span class="tei tei-q">“to meet the
Lord in the air.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The resurrection state is that to which the
ancients looked for the restoration of Israel.

Rabbi Eliezer the great, supposed to have
lived just after the second temple was built,
applied Hosea 14:8 to the pious Jews, who
seemed likely to die without seeing the glory
of Israel, saying: <span class="tei tei-q">“As I live, saith Jehovah,
I will raise you up, in the resurrection of the
dead; and I will gather you with all Israel.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Sadducees are reported to have asked
Rabbi Gamaliel, the preceptor of Paul,
whence he would prove that God would
raise the dead, who quoted Deut. 9:21:
<span class="tei tei-q">“Which land the Lord sware that he would
give to your <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fathers</span></em>.”</span> He argued, as Abraham,
Isaac and Jacob had it not, and as God

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Rabbi Saahias Gaion, commenting on Dan.
12:2, says: <span class="tei tei-q">“This is the resuscitation of the
dead Israel, whose lot is eternal life, and those
who shall not awake are the forsakers of
Jehovah.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“In the world to come,”</span> says the Sahar,
fol. 81, <span class="tei tei-q">“the blessed God will vivify the dead
and raise them from their dust, so that they
shall be no more an earthly structure.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus <span class="tei tei-q">“Abraham, when he was called to
go out into a place which he should after
receive for an inheritance ... sojourned in
the land of promise, as in a strange country,
dwelling in tabernacles, with Isaac and Jacob,
the heirs with him of the same promise; for
he looked for a city which hath foundations,
whose builder and maker is God,”</span> Heb. 11:8-10.
While he dwelt in that land, God
<span class="tei tei-q">“gave him none inheritance in it, no, not so
much as to set his foot on; yet he promised
that he would give it to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">him</span></em> for a possession,
and to his seed after him,”</span> Acts 7:5. This
was also true of all those <span class="tei tei-q">“who died in faith,
not having received the promises, but having
seen them afar off, and were persuaded of
them, and embraced them, and confessed that
they were strangers and pilgrims on the
earth,”</span>—desiring <span class="tei tei-q">“a better country, that is,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page360">[pg 360]</span><a name="Pg360" id="Pg360" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
a heavenly”</span> (Heb. 11:13-16), <span class="tei tei-q">“not accepting
deliverance, that they might obtain a better
resurrection”</span> (v. 35), <span class="tei tei-q">“God having provided
some better thing for us, that they
without us should not be made perfect,”</span> v. 40.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When the promises are thus made good to
Israel, all who are of the faith of Abraham
will participate in the same promises. For
<span class="tei tei-q">“Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of
the law ... that the blessing of Abraham
might come on the Gentiles through Jesus
Christ.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“And if ye be Christ's, then are ye
Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the
promise,”</span> Gal. 3:13, 14, 29. So the Saviour
said to the Jews: <span class="tei tei-q">“Many shall come from the
east and west, and shall sit down with Abraham,
and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of
heaven; but the children of the kingdom [unregenerate
Jews] shall be cast into outer darkness,”</span>
Matt. 8:11, 12. And then, as the
Saviour said to the twelve: <span class="tei tei-q">“Ye which have
followed me, in the regeneration when the
Son of man shall sit in the throne of his
glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones,
judging the twelve tribes of Israel,”</span> Matt. 19:28.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The rest of the dead,”</span> who live not
again till the thousand years are ended, must
be the wicked dead; for, the righteous being
raised, no other dead ones remain. They
include all the wicked, who have died in all
ages, and <span class="tei tei-q">“the remnant”</span> who <span class="tei tei-q">“are slain
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page361">[pg 361]</span><a name="Pg361" id="Pg361" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
with the sword”</span> (19:21), when the kingdom
is cleansed from all things that offend.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The thousand years”</span> to intervene between
the two resurrections, are regarded by some
as a symbol of 360,000 years. There seems
to be no necessity for such an interpretation.
When time is symbolized, it is always proportioned
to the duration of the other symbols
used. Thus, in Dan. 8th, when beasts symbolize
kingdoms, it would have been incongruous
to have specified the duration of the
vision in literal years; for beasts do not continue
during centuries, as the kingdoms symbolized
by them have done. But days are
proportioned to years, as beasts are to kingdoms;
so that there is a fitness in symbolizing
the years foreshadowed in that vision, by
2300 days; between which measure of time
and the duration of the existence of beasts,
there is a perfect congruity.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the 4th of Daniel, where the cutting
down of a tree is used to symbolize the loss
of the king's reason, there is no such disproportion
between the duration of man's existence
and that of a tree, as there is between
the life of a beast and that of an empire.
And therefore there is no incongruity if the
time specified is a symbol of literal time, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
if a time is used to symbolize a year. In this
case, the seven years could not have been
symbolized by seven days; for there is no
marked disproportion between the duration
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page362">[pg 362]</span><a name="Pg362" id="Pg362" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the other symbols in connection, and the
things symbolized; and had days been used,
days must have been understood in the fulfilment.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There might be either 1000 years, or 360,000,
between the first and second resurrections,
without conflicting with any other Scripture.
But there is no disproportion between the
other symbols and the things symbolized,—the
living again of the martyrs in vision, and
their actual resurrection; and therefore the
1000 years need not, by any parallel usage
or law of language, be understood, to be other
than a literal thousand.

Verses 11-15 contain the record of the
symbolization John saw, of what was to
transpire at the end of the thousand years;
while verses 7-10 appear to be explanatory
of events which would then be fulfilled.
This explanation, previous to the exhibition
of the symbolization, is appropriate in the
connection, and makes more forcible the fact
that <span class="tei tei-q">“the rest of the dead lived not again
until the thousand years were finished.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As the rest of the dead live not till the end
of the thousand years, they come forth at
<span class="tei tei-q">“the resurrection of damnation,”</span> at the end
of a thousand years of the reign of the saints
on the earth, and at the epoch when Satan
was to be loosed from his prison. As all who
had part in the first resurrection were to be
exempted from the power of the second death,
the nations who are then deceived by Satan,
must be the nations composing the rest of the
dead, who live again at that epoch.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Their number <span class="tei tei-q">“as the sand of the sea,”</span>
and their coming from <span class="tei tei-q">“the four quarters of
the earth,”</span> show that they are no obscure
people, living unknown to the saints; and
their existence can only be accounted for by
the event of a resurrection of the wicked.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page364">[pg 364]</span><a name="Pg364" id="Pg364" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Their names, <span class="tei tei-q">“Gog and Magog,”</span>—those
applied to the ancient enemies of Israel,
(Ezek. 38:38),—are appropriate titles to
designate the subjects of the second resurrection.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
They encompass the camp of the saints,
and the beloved city—showing that the city
descends at the commencement of the thousand
years—but there is no battle: before they
are permitted to harm the saints, fire from
heaven devours them; and the devil that
thought to lead them against the holy city, is
cast into the lake of fire, where the beast and
false prophet were cast at the commencement
of the millennium.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In connection with the resurrection of the
wicked, is their judgment—not following
necessarily in the precise order of the record.
The <span class="tei tei-q">“small and great”</span> who stand before
God, are not small and large persons, but
those from all stations and ranks in society.
The king and the beggar equally receive
according to their deserts: They are the
bond and the free, the high and the low, the
rich and the poor, including those who fought
against the Lamb, and were overcome by
Him, 19:18.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The open books symbolize the record of
their evil deeds, for which they are to be
judged. And the <span class="tei tei-q">“book of Life”</span> is opened
to symbolize that the names of those who are
judged are not there recorded, and that consequently
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page365">[pg 365]</span><a name="Pg365" id="Pg365" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
they are justly condemned. To
<span class="tei tei-q">“him that overcometh,”</span> the Saviour promised
<span class="tei tei-q">“I will not blot his name out of this book of
life,”</span> 3:3.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The sea, death, and hell giving up their dead,
indicates that all of the <span class="tei tei-q">“rest of the dead”</span>
are here resurrected, and that none are left
out from among whom these are raised, as
these were, from whom came forth the subjects
of the first resurrection.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The casting of death and hell into the lake
of fire, symbolizes the casting in of those who
were within their domains; and <span class="tei tei-q">“the lake of

The new heaven and new earth are symbols
of the new order of things. The old
heavens and earth having been dissolved,
their elements melting with fervent heat
(2 Pet. 3:12), the <span class="tei tei-q">“new heavens and the

for which Peter looked, succeed to their place.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page366">[pg 366]</span><a name="Pg366" id="Pg366" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
So much more resplendent are these than the

of all things spoken of by the mouth of
all the holy prophets,”</span> Acts 3:21. Whether
the new creation will comprise both sea and
dry land, as was first created (Gen. 1:10), is
not here decided; but there is no reason to
suppose that this characteristic of the original
creation will be forever obliterated.

The new Jerusalem descends, adorned as a

adulterous woman (17:3), and also by the
corrupt city of Babylon (18:2), so symbols

Mr. Lord very justly remarks: <span class="tei tei-q">“The descent

The utterances of the <span class="tei tei-q">“great voice out of

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <span class="tei tei-q">“tabernacle of God with men”</span> is explained
in the same connection to be his
<span class="tei tei-q">“dwelling with them.”</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“When our Saviour was incarnate, and
vouchsafed to dwell amongst the children of

closely, it is, he set his tabernacle amongst

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shekinah</span></span>, or divine presence (Maimon, Mor.
Nev. par. 1, chap. 25), comes from a word of
the like signification, and found with the
Greek word here used. Therefore there will

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When Israel first entered the wilderness,
God entered into a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">covenant</span></span> with them (Ex. 19:3-8),
in consequence of which he said
to Moses, <span class="tei tei-q">“Let them make me a sanctuary,
that I may dwell among them,”</span> (Ex. 25:8)—the
pattern of which was shown Moses in
the mount; and when completed <span class="tei tei-q">“the glory of
the Lord filled the tabernacle”</span> (Ex. 40:34),
and there <span class="tei tei-q">“the Lord talked with Moses,”</span> Ex. 33:9.
Thus did God dwell among them
while they were in a probationary state; but
he indicated a more intimate connection
with them, by promising, if they were obedient
to his statutes in all things, that <span class="tei tei-q">“I will
set my tabernacle among you: and my soul
shall not abhor you. And I will walk among
you, and will be your God, and ye shall be
my people,”</span> Lev. 26:11, 12. This promise
was not fulfilled to the Jews, because of their
sins; but Paul quotes it (2 Cor. 6:16), and
applies it as a promise still to be made good
to the church of Christ. Thus, the <span class="tei tei-q">“Word”</span>
that <span class="tei tei-q">“was God,”</span> who was made flesh and
tabernacled among us at his incarnation, is
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page370">[pg 370]</span><a name="Pg370" id="Pg370" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
again to come and dwell with us in his
human tabernacle, as at his first advent.
Then will God enter into a new covenant
with his people, as he has said: <span class="tei tei-q">“Behold, the
days come, saith the Lord, that I will make
a new covenant with the house of Israel, and
with the house of Judah; not according to
the covenant that I made with their fathers,
in the day that I took them by the hand, to
bring them out of the land of Egypt, which
my covenant they brake, although I was a
husband unto them, saith the Lord; but this
shall be the covenant that I will make with
the house of Israel; After those days, saith
the Lord, I will put my law in their inward
parts, and write it in their hearts; and will
be their God, and they shall be my people.
And they shall teach no more every man his
neighbor, and every man his brother, saying,
Know the Lord: for they shall all know me,
from the least of them unto the greatest of
them, saith the Lord: for I will forgive their
iniquity, and I will remember their sin no
more,”</span> Jer. 31:31-34.

As the saints, before the resurrection of
<span class="tei tei-q">“the rest of the dead,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“reign with Christ
1000 years,”</span> (20:4); it follows that during
that period the tabernacle of God is with
men, when he dwells among them, which is
an additional evidence that <span class="tei tei-q">“the restitution

This is a tearless state—all tears being
then wiped from every eye. Isaiah predicted,
when <span class="tei tei-q">“He will swallow up death in victory,”</span>
that <span class="tei tei-q">“the Lord God will wipe away tears
from off all faces: and the rebuke of his
people shall he take away from off all the
earth: for the Lord hath spoken it. And it
shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God;
we have waited for him, and he will save us:
this is the Lord; we have waited for him, we
will be glad and rejoice in his salvation,”</span> Isa.
25:8, 9. The commencement of the tearless
state is thus placed by Isaiah at the resurrection,
and at the appearance of Christ; which
is confirmed by Paul, in his inspired commentary
on the same, who affirms that at the
last trump, <span class="tei tei-q">“when this corruptible shall have
put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have
put on immortality, then shall be brought to
pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed
up in victory,”</span> 1 Cor. 15:54. This
state was also promised to the entire company
<span class="tei tei-q">“which came out of great tribulation, and
have washed their robes, and made them
white in the blood of the Lamb. Therefore
are they before the throne of God, and serve
him day and night in his temple: and he that
sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them.
They shall hunger no more, neither thirst
any more; neither shall the sun light on
them, nor any heat. For the Lamb, which is
in the midst of the throne, shall feed them,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page372">[pg 372]</span><a name="Pg372" id="Pg372" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and shall lead them unto living fountains of
waters: and God shall wipe away all tears
from their eyes,”</span> Rev. 7:14-17.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There shall then <span class="tei tei-q">“be no more death”</span>—for
that <span class="tei tei-q">“last enemy shall be destroyed”</span> (1 Cor. 15:26),
and there shall be nothing to
<span class="tei tei-q">“hurt nor destroy, in all my holy mountain,
saith the Lord.”</span> Death will have been swallowed
up in victory, (Isa. 25:8)—the redeemed
having been ransomed <span class="tei tei-q">“from the
power of the grave,”</span> Hos. 13:14. <span class="tei tei-q">“Neither
can they die any more: for they are equal
unto the angels; and are the children of God,
being the children of the resurrection,”</span> Luke
20:36.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
After the destruction of death, there shall
be <span class="tei tei-q">“neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall
there be any more pain.”</span> This was to be
when <span class="tei tei-q">“the ransomed of the Lord shall return,
and come to Zion with songs and everlasting
joy upon their heads: they shall obtain joy
and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall
flee away,”</span> Isa. 35:10. And one of these
songs was to be: <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou wast slain, and hast
redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every
kindred and tongue, and people and nation;
and hast made us unto our God kings and
priests: and we shall reign on the earth,”</span>
Rev. 5:9,10.

Then, everything which distinguishes the
present world from that, will have passed
away; for all things will be created anew.

These words, uttered by Him who is the
<span class="tei tei-q">“Alpha and Omega,”</span> are no rhetorical flourishes,
nor mere figures of speech, but contain
the exact and literal truth, and are not to be
set aside as unmeaning figures. For He
who sat upon the throne has declared:
<span class="tei tei-q">“These words are true and faithful.”</span> Faithful
is He who hath promised, and he will
surely make good his words—bestowing on
the righteous the inheritance of all things;
and on the wicked, their fearful doom.

till the time of the end,”</span> Dan. 12:9. The
Apocalypse, as its name imports, being an
<span class="tei tei-q">“unveiling”</span> of the obscurities of Daniel, the
seal from the former was removed—the time
of the end, in that sense, being equivalent to
the last days, or the gospel dispensation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The time was <span class="tei tei-q">“at hand,”</span> when the great
series of predicted events was to commence.
As he that was unjust was to be unjust still,
and he that was righteous was thus to remain,
it follows that the visions therein recorded,
continue down to the close of probation; and
that the new earth is one of everlasting reward,
wherein is to be fulfilled the promise:
<span class="tei tei-q">“Blessed are the meek; for they shall inherit
the earth,”</span> Matt. 5:3.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In this connection the Saviour answers the
question, which so perplexed the Pharisees:
If David then call him Lord, how is he his
son? Matt. 22:45. Being the Root from
whence David sprang, and in his humanity
David's offspring, he was both his Lord and
son.

The invitation appended is one of the most
endearing that it is possible to conceive of,
and the threats are the most terrific. These
are given for the admonition of all; and yet
how many will turn away from the study of
the book, which commences with a blessing
on him <span class="tei tei-q">“that readeth, and they that hear the
words of this prophecy, and keep those things
which are written therein,”</span> (1:3); and
closes with an invitation for all to come
and <span class="tei tei-q">“take of the water of life freely.”</span> It is
no mystical record, and there is nothing equivocal
in its predictions. Neither is it to be fulfilled
in the distant future; for <span class="tei tei-q">“He which
testifieth these things saith: Surely I come
quickly.”</span> And shall not every one who loves
his Lord respond, <span class="tei tei-q">“Even so; come, Lord
Jesus.”</span>
